        "message": "from nato. Nato is an alliance with capitalist nations to go against socialist nations. So it was necessary. So this means the ussr and gdr had to isolate itself economically and politically. The west was built up by the marshall plan and was funded heavily. Remember the usa was never bombed. Pearl harbor barely counts. That means the war never touched its industries like it did france uk and belgium etc. So the usa could throw money. The iron curtain had to be self sufficient. Which means not have foreign governments fund it or take control of it. This is a very important thing for marxist leninists. As if you have someone else like a foreign company build ur industry they control the country and imperialized the people. We see the usa do this with its banana republics in the 50s in south america. So the iron curtain cut itself off from the world. I think this is not optimal. The east saw the shiny shit the west got and wanted some of it. Not because they had no food or no home. They lived modestly.  But the west had fast fashion and pop culture and and much luxury. And i think this is because of the iron curtain. So the wall was made to keep people out as well as in. So a more powerful state and then a crush on dissent and critique. And critique is important. As i mentioned they sometimes did not fulfill their 5 year quotas for the plan sometimes and it could hurt some aspects of life. And so the wall fell and like a domino effect the entire ussr.\n\nDespite its failures the gdr was waaay better than fascist germany. And imo the west. So empirically we can see that communism with a capital \"C\" is better than fascism and are not comparable. Communism served the people. While its modest and not flashy it does not give the rich ultra power. I think we lump a big state and army as fascism. So much to the point that many anarchists call it red fascism. I dont have time to get into that can of worms but needless to say fascism is mass privatization and the state protecting the corporations along huge bigotry and nationalism to justify it. We are much closer to fascism than socialism. And yet people fear china and socialism and not the alt right taking power. Now the alt right is disjointed and does not have the strategy to gain power. Trump just fed off the base. He didnt have any goals of fascism except to give tax cuts. Trumps a fascist but not a well coordinated one. This could happen again. This is happening again.

Losing their slave labor and massive casualties had caused germany to fall.\n\n\nEast germany\n\nNow. Whenever we talk about east germany or the gdr we always talk about how its the shittier version of germany. And whenever people give the reason ehy theu usually say cause it was socialist. Thats not a good faith argument. For one east germany had always been behind industrially. Most of south and eastern parts of germany were agrarian society. The industry was in the north and west. To put into context imagine if the confederates had their way and there was 2 sides to America. A north and the south. The north had the industry and the major ports and cities(its how the union won by strangling the confederates). It would be a terrible take to say that the confederate south was bad economically becuse they had slavery when thats not true. Even though slavery is bad. Slavery as we saw with hitler makes a shit ton of profits and industry. Thats how it was like historically with germany. The east was always less industrialized. Im talking about railways and shit. Most of the industry sits in the Rhine region(the west) where coal is mined. Where wod corporations wanna settle? The argarian almost empty east? Or the industrialized west. All this before the war \n\nNow remember how i said most of the war was fought on the eastern front? Well now we can see what germany had to deal with. It was more bombed than the west. So as marxism leninism does it needed to rebuild the country from the ground up. This means it took stalins stablization theory and used state owned enterprises and centralism to build the east up from the ground. This created jobs and the 5 year plans while some failed to meet quotas did build up the gdr. For example commie blocks in the city helped reduce homelessness. They were modest and not flashy but waay better than living in rubble. Its actually way better than some of the public housing i used to live in here in the usa. Hunger was cut as there was price stabilization and food was collectivized. School was free. Healthcare was free. It was built on public ownership of means of production and labor unions.  Women had a rights to abortion and more freedom than what fascist germany had. In fact there is a book called Why women have better sex under socialism. In my opinion its meh. Shes kinda always saying. The gdr was horrible and a failure and always trying to distance herself from it. And ismt very good with analyzing socialist economics. But she does show that if you give women economic freedom and social freedom they have happier sex lives. Because under capitalism women are relegated to do domestic work and work in the economy amd the right to an abortion allows for women to choose their own path. Conservative societies stifle women whereas a collective society like the gdr allowed for women to do their own thing as there was free daycare, healthcare, abortion, healthcare, and social safety nets. \n\nThat was all under socialist germany. How is socialism the same as fascism. Ideologically and economically they are diametrically opposed. Under communism or marxism leninism the means of production are made public and a social good built on labor unions wherethe economy plans production and prices are stablized. Compare that to fascisms mass privatization and need for racism and bigotry to manufacture consent to use slave labor for the corporations. So if socialist germany is better than fascist germany why did it fall?\n\nWell many things. The iron curtain was bad. Warsaw was bad etc. Now i could sit here like an armchair leftist in the imperial core but lemme add some nuance. Warsaw was needed to build strong alliances as a union. And the iron curtain was a way to stop infiltration",

Before that happened, I received tons of great ideas to share with these people and now they\u2019re organizing and taking a collective stand.\n\nI was hoping you all might have more ideas how we can help them fight for their homes.\n\n\nTHEY TOLD PEOPLE TO GO TO A HOMELESS SHELTER IF THEY COULDN\u2019T FIND A NEW PLACE (Up to 150 families \ud83e\udd14)\n\n#RiseUpNicholasville\n\nUpdate: Reddit spam filter took down the post in r/antiwork and the mods elected to not bring it back, as it had veered beyond the scope of the sub. They were cool about it and I understand their decision, but this cause still needs more online traction.\n\nTenants are organizing and discussing \u201ckey for rent\u201d or rent strike tactics! They\u2019re pissed as hell and they\u2019re going to fight for their homes.\n\nI\u2019m doxxing myself, but I don\u2019t care. A property management group called Brookside Properties, Inc. (Nashville, TN) took over a low income apartment complex in my town (Nicholasville, KY). They sent out eviction notices less than 2 weeks before Christmas to all residents, giving them until January 31st to vacate.\n\nThese people are now scrambling to find a place to live and scratch together a security deposit instead of enjoying Christmas. One of my coworkers is being impacted and it\u2019s all she can think about. The first time she mentioned it, I thought, \u201cOh, that sucks!\u201d The second time, I actually really thought/felt about it and now I\u2019m seeing red. I\u2019m so fucking pissed off. This woman is older and hasn\u2019t had an easy life. She has a job where she\u2019s making decent money, she\u2019s clean, and now she\u2019s afraid she\u2019s going to have to move 30 miles away for affordable housing.\n\nNicholasville is a town of 20,000 that\u2019s being absorbed by Lexington. There\u2019s a complete dearth of 1 BR apartments and rent is skyrocketing. Waitlists run 9 months to 1 year. These people are going to wind up having to leave the community or be homeless.\n\nBrookside Properties, you fucking soulless bastards. You suck. Who does something like this to low income people at Christmas.\n\nEDIT: The apartments are called Treetop (Properties) Apartments and the townhouses are Beauford Townhomes and they\u2019re located at 500 Beauford Place Nicholasville, KY 40356 also 720 South Main Street.\n\nhttps://www.lex18.com/news/lex-18-investigates/its-legal-but-its-not-right-jessamine-county-apartment-complex-tells-dozens-to-vacate-by-jan-31?fbclid=IwAR3s0OejE8O8A6nTmWODM2tWZTyQAhZ-_8PFHw2h55FtJ2iq80qqhk8fTBM\n\nThank you for the rewards, guys. I hope we can actually make a difference for these people so I feel like I earned them. \n\nAnd thank y\u2019all for carving out a little time during this holiday to concern yourself with events in a relatively podunk town in Kentucky to offer suggestions and advice.

        "message": "If we have in fact reached peak oil, an economic crash will happen soon\n\nOur global economy still largely runs on fossil fuels. Renewables have increased their share of electricity generation, but they still only account for less than 1/3 of generation globally. But electricity generation is only one area that is highly dependent on fossil fuels, and oil specifically. Oil is not only heavily used in transportation and distribution, but in manufacturing. Very many products require oil for their production. If oil production has peaked, the price of oil will only continue to increase. Briefly in 2020 the price of oil plummeted, due to a dramatic drop in demand from pandemic lockdowns and quarantines. However, since then the price of oil has gone back up considerably, because the demand for most everything has come roaring back as the economy has reopened, and as demand for things increases, so too does the demand for oil.\n\nIf we have in fact reached peak oil production as some believe, the cost of many, many things will go up. This price inflation could hit many people very hard, motivating the US Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to combat the rising inflation. This will likely have dramatic economic consequences.\n\nThe US economy especially is heavily dependent on debt to keep growing. In order for consumers to continue buying more and more expensive stuff, and in order for investors to continue buying more and more expensive assets, taking on more and more debt is needed. But debt must be paid back with interest. When interest rates are low, it is easier to service debt, but as interest rates go up, debt service becomes more burdensome. As the cost of borrowing increases, fewer people are able to take out a loan to buy a house or a car. Demand decreases which could lead to a crash in one or more asset markets.\n\nWhen economic analysts say the fundamentals of the economy are strong, what they mean is that there is plenty of money in the economy and plenty of demand for products and services. Those same economists assume supply will follow demand and price equilibrium well be achieved. But, this assumption is based on a belief that the inputs into supply production will be able to remain constant enough (once pandemic related disruptions end) at low enough prices for supply to sufficiently meet demand. This is a false assumption. We can theoretically create infinite demand, but we do not have access to infinite energy, infinite raw materials (especially oil), nor do we have access to infinite labor that we can rely on to be infinitely productive. Money creation and human desires may be unlimited, but supply is not, so prices will inflate.\n\nThat is unless we haven't actually reached peak oil. If oil production can increase then the price of oil won't go up, or at least not as fast, and prices won't necessarily inflate as much or as quickly (although I'd like to point out that labor is an underestimated wild card here, I'm not sure we can expect the same productivity gains going forward that we have come to expect over the past 40 or 50 years). However, if oil production has peaked, price inflation will accelerate, leading to either a crash due to runaway inflation or a crash due to rising interest rates leading to a drop in demand.\n\nIf oil production has not yet peaked and the price of oil is able to stay relatively stable, the economy might be able to continue to grow at manageable levels of inflation, but if that happens, global carbon emissions will increase beyond the 2019 peak, because carbon emissions are nowhere near being decoupled from economic growth.\n\nhttps://redd.it/roct7i\n@failures_of_capitalism",

Almost every weekend morning was spent in wide-eyed wonder as David Attenborough and Steve Irwin guided me through the mysteries and beauty of the natural world. They felt like promises made: this planet is wonderful and wild, come see it for yourself! I was hooked.\n\nThe one thing I remember most about these programs were the consistent themes of conservation and protection - but the wild world felt too vast and untouchable to my elementary school mind to truly be in any danger. How could humans ever realistically produce enough waste to fill the ocean with plastic or rivers with garbage? It felt impossible.\n\nIt\u2019s so hard to see their warnings become realized. Reefs bleaching, trash islands the size of countries, micro plastic polluting every corner of the globe. Forests burning, ice melting, bird populations plummeting so low that a walk through the woods feels strange and quiet. Anywhere and everywhere you look, nature is on the decline, and has been since those shows first aired.\n\nI just can\u2019t watch nature docs anymore. It\u2019s like watching an obituary. It hurts too much to think what could have been if we\u2019d acted sooner, or acted at all.  And that one day I\u2019ll have to show these programs to my grandchildren with a very different promise than the one Steve Irwin made to me: this planet was wonderful and wild once.

On May 12, Connolly and other leaders of the rising were tried by a secret British court-martial that lasted only a few minutes and executed by firing squad. \n\nConnolly believed sacrificing his life was necessary to inspire Irish people to take up arms against British rule, which indeed it would come to do in the years and decades that followed. Shortly before his execution his wife Lille said to him: \"Your life, James, your beautiful life.\" to which he replied: \"Well, Lillie, hasn't it been a beautiful life, and isn't this a good end?",

To this day, entire fields of study have been dedicated to \"organizational management\" and \"workforce optimization.\" The hierarchies that exist today, whether in private or public organizations, stem from archaic forms of management designed to essentially make humans less human... Ultimately, these fields of study have developed the corporate culture that has become synonymous with capitalist society: extreme hierarchies, a total absence of autonomy, strict guidelines and rules, threats of disciplinary action, and complete submission to conformity. These organizational hierarchies have been placed everywhere - within most corporations, most companies, most schools, most non-profits, most NGOs, and most public agencies. Quite simply stated, they are a necessary component in maintaining the unnatural wealth and power inequities that are so rampant within the capitalist system.

To recap, I've been accused of sending unsolicited NSFW material to people, causing a lot of emotional damage in general, and making rape threats.\n\nScreenshots have piled up of the first two, while the third doesn't have any evidence backing it up: it was never my intention to send rape threats, and I do understand if what I did send felt like that, as such I can only apologise for them.\nI've seen the screenshots, they're real. I haven't deleted the chats, they're still here, I can see them too, it was fucked up. I've been so abusive, I'm truly ashamed of myself.\n\nInitially I reacted with hostility to the accusations, denying them at every opportunity, but I cannot undo what I've done and the accusations themselves are credible: I really did behave in a manipulative fashion, I really did send people NSFW artwork that they didn't want to see, I am not going to deny those things.\n\nThe truth is, I find myself thinking manipulatively a lot, and when I recognise it I'm quick to stop and think \"What the hell is wrong with me?\", but that doesn't always happen. Sometimes I go through with the manipulative behaviour, and I find that disgusting. I've been working on this for a while, trying to recognise my impulses and correct them: lately I've been giving those close to me the tools and info to recognize manipulative behaviour so they can hold me accountable and help me address it.\n\nAs for the NSFW, I can't really say much except that it's not a thing I do anymore. That's not really a satisfactory response, but it's the simple truth and I cannot undo what I've already done: I sent NSFW material to people who never asked for it and sometimes even asked me to stop, and that was terrible. The document also mentions a 13-year-old being found on the receiving end of that, and that just goes to show how dangerous what I was doing is. I did not know they were underage and I didn't care to ask, that is on me. This particular incident proves that I was way too careless in doing something that was already wrong.\n\nI acted manipulatively and I sent people porn they didn't want, I'm ready to own up to those things and change as a person.\nI had already stopped sending people porn without their explicit permission and I am now working on my manipulative side.\n\nIt might not be worth much, but I apologise to the people I have hurt. The fact that I caused you harm on top of the way I reacted when this initially came out is unforgivable to me, I really hope things get better for you and I'm sorry about everything I did.\n\nThis is Shawn signing off, hoping better times are ahead",

I had been there before, but not for quite a few years. \n\nThis exhibit is nestled on a far corner of the museum, and the only way to get through it is to get through the taxidermy exhibit, which I hate. (Technically you can get through it through the catering area, but there's always stuff going on there, and it isn't shown on the museum map that you can get to it this way). It feels very cut off from the rest of the museum. \n\nThe first room in this exhibit showcases a repatriation ceremony from the 90s that the museum participated in, and there's a sign in the middle of this room that talks about why you might see certain items removed, so that they can work more closely with local tribes to understand the materials. Throughout the exhibit, there are quite a few things missing. either with no explanation or that proudly declares the item repatriated. \n\nImmediately you notice a language shift from the rest of the museum. They're *trying* to be careful, they're trying to be *extra* respectful, and they fail at it. \n\nI really wish I took pictures, I will next time I go, but here are two examples I remember the most: \n\n- Talking about how a west coast tribe was almost eradicated but \"persevered\" despite the influence of \"outside forces.\" The truth of European colonization is changed into a narrative about the noble strength of the victims. \n\n- A couple dioramas showcased missionaries and tribes trading HUDSON'S BAY blankets. Looking at these, we wondered if these were the infamous smallpox blankets - and after looking it up, we found out that historians are fairly certain they are, but the museum does not mention this.",

This is a friendly reminder that other than the families and friends of the victims of the attack, absolutely nobody should be remembering this event unless they want to celebrate a wound on the American empire. \n\nThe victims are what should matter, but the media never talks about them: what they talk about instead is how bad they feel about the towers going down and, on a deeper level, the blow dealt to the empire, a reminder that despite how much the US tries to make itself seem untouchable, powerful, invincible, it's still just a slab of land populated by mortal people.\n\nWe also have to keep in mind another couple crucial points: the racism and islamophobia hiding right behind the obsession with the attack and the fact that the US was just begging for it by doing horrific war crimes in the Middle East. The US had and has been carrying out attacks in the Middle East with several times the body count of 9/11, and the victims there are also usually civilians. I wonder why you don't hear about that as much.\n\nOf course, it was an act of terrorism that killed many innocent people, and that is not what we are happy about.\nToday we let those who actually lost something on that day mourn in peace without getting in their way, but we also celebrate a reminder that America's day will come.\n\nOnce again, happy 9/11 and death to the United States of America",

As I hope we can all agree, explicit consent is a necessity.\n- Pink calling me \"the morality police\" for saying that sex requires consent is... pretty worrying on its own, and being made even worse by the fact that they're replying to the guy who thinks you can \"feel\" consent.\n- Blue is just a queerphobe as we're about to see, so of course they immediately start off by invalidating non-binary gender identities.\n- I respond accordingly.\n- Blue's mask comes flying right off as they use the classic homophobic slur that I'm sure I don't need to repeat. That \"signs of a larger issue\" comment is really interesting in the context of a thread about a \"meme\" in which women are treated as though their consent is not important.\n- Finally, Cyan swoops in and sums up the entire issue perfectly",

If you believe a better world is possible, you have to believe that it's not that people are bad, but that there's some conditioning force that causes human cruelty and, by extension, that there is a means to overcome that force.  I'm not trying to argue that you have to forgive the people who hurt you or that it isn't a poor use of time to try to reform some people, but I am arguing that you have to give people the room to learn and grow out of the selfish, violent and privileged mindsets that they were raised in.",

Ok let's get OT a bit because I'm a huge geek unfortunately.\n\nNow, I used to be a huge tech bro a few years ago, and I still follow the tech industry quite closely, so let me just state: what'd you need to beat Apple at their phone game (that is, one where hardware and software are deeply integrated, and Apple is the only one that can design the entire phone by themselves from the SoC to the SW) is so insanely difficult to achieve, you'd might as well give up. You need the finances of a company in the trillions, the established software, IP and capabilities of a silicon valley giant, and the hardware resources of a huge manufacturer that produces a lot of hardware (and I mean a lot, which in turns requires established chains of production and distribution) which, realistically (sic!) speaking, would probably mean Google's software, Samsung's general hardware (and I mean not just Samsung Mobile, but all the other relevant divisions as well) and TSMC's IP and knowledge. Like, if they put all their resources, IP, knowledge, research and finances together, then they could maybe come up with a game changer in the current market, but this collaboration would be nonsense business-speaking (they're all dominant in their own markets already, and TSMC and Google work more like platforms. Google Software-wide, while TSMC is the global standard for SoCs and has a shit-ton of clients), and the margins in the phone market are razor thin, so why bother anyways?\nI understand that the title of the video is Ultra clickbait, but Tesla entering the phone market would be the fail of the decade. It makes no sense. It can barely make its cars, and they've been operating on a loss for years. Now they're not doing it anymore, but still, why start again? For the phone market, which is ultra-competitive? And in a phase where Chinese brands have systemic advantages that'll let them dominate in the following years? \n\nThis is so incredibly dumb on so many levels. And yes, it's a personality cult.",

Her previous posts and answers are about trans people (in particular, promoting one person who decided to detransition).\nI think this might be the clearest illustration of point 1. In attacking trans women, Rowling adopted a certain conception of what a woman ought to be that became so reactionary, that probably now she doesn't hate the whole decision that much, perhaps she might agree with it because maybe now she really does think that a women ought to have only a reproductive role in society. TERFism was a hook by the far-right (more on that here), and many, many liberal feminists (as well as some cis lesbian women, and it pains me to notice this, but I like to think it's but a miniscule minority) absolutely fell for it. \nAnd it's very telling that JK Rowling, who used to drool over Tony Blair and has always been close to that centrist side of the Labor Party, could now have turned out to be just a reactionary neoliberal after all",

The fascist woman wasn't just the archetype of the woman under the patriarchy, but was herself an active component in the revolution. The same happens here: these women do have a certain vision of what women ought to do with their lives, but are themselves not entirely part of it, for they're part of the reaction aimed exactly at this political transformation. If you think it is contradictory, it is. But fascism is full of contradictions. It is built on contradictions. That's why it requires this constant propaganda to be upheld. And rather than weakening it, the contradictions gives fascism its strength, by allowing for a constant switch of positions that cannot be attacked: in this case, if I (a cis white man, to be clear) confronted these women on what they're doing, they would use their \"strong emancipated woman\" card to justify their actions, to then call me the real bigot who's trying to force his views on women (something that has been already employed multiple times by the women I mentioned). But then they'd immediately go back to promoting \"traditional values\".\nThe way to defeat this is to destroy the propagandistic apparatus that fascism nurtures on.

For instance, many of them said this about abortion, but when Pence said that the next step is a nationwide ban (therefore, federal legislation), nobody was surprised. They knew what to say, they knew it was bullshit, and now they're taking the next step in their agenda. \nAnd they do this when they speak \"of freedom\" and \"liberty\", and they do this when they talk about \"liberating\" other countries, they do it when they whine they're \"discriminated\" against, they do it when they talk about Christianity and religion.\nThey do realize it's all bullshit, but at the same time they act as if it wasn't nthe case, and this behavior is both uniform, as well as common. \nAnd one has to realize how much such a population needs to be fed propaganda, for how long, and how fanatical and irrational they need to be.

        "message": "I saw a post recently on Tumblr that said that everything that is happening right now in the US is the consequence of people not voting for Clinton in 2016. And it was shared by leftists too.\n\nAnd, first off: no? I could get into the details as to why, but frankly I'd rather not write an essay: Clinton lost because Clinton did not convince the electorate to vote for her, and didn't make any concessions whatsoever. She could've won it and she blew it. Her loss is completely her fault. Completely. 100%. Case closed.\n\nI think that, in general, in a situation in which you have a corrupt, technocratic neoliberal centrist on one side and a fascist on the other, you have already lost. There's absolutely no point in voting for a Biden, a Blair, a Clinton, a Renzi, a Macron, a Starmer just to stop the right. These kinds of people are exactly why we're here. Voting for them means being in denial. These people are setting the ground for fascism. They do it everyday when they ally themselves with the right, when they do everything legal and illegal to stop leftists, when they make sure leftists lose, when they give the benefit of the doubt to fascists, when they promote austerity and neoliberal policies. And when their policies turn out to be unpopular, they let the right challenge them and win, because these people are fucking morons that almost nobody actually likes.\n\nAnd just to be fair, I don't think that the useful vote is always a bad idea. It's usually a centrist bs excuse for voting the neoliberal, but as a concept it makes sense: compromise now a bit just to stop the right-winger, win the next time. But if you apply it, you must make sure that the guy you're voting for ALSO won't set the perfect ground for the fascist next time around. This is exactly why it doesn't make sense in presidential elections in the US. \nSecondly, you must be sure of the fact that this guy is (personally, you decide the threshold, I know I'm way too lax) at least part of the liberal left to be considered for a useful vote (and it is always a case-by-case approach) and both a genuine candidate despite being a liberal, and a generally liked person.\nAnd finally, the useful vote can be seriously considered only when it is seen as a starting point to shift the country to the left. The candidate/politician must be able and willing to approve some socialdemocratic policies, at least, be able to show that these more leftist policies are genuine and positive, and thus both diminish the risk of a take over by the far-right, but also allow for a shift to the left.",

And given that we have only one shot at consciousness, that is an enormous waste.\nWe should strive to create a society that truly allows for the free development of individualities, but in the meantime we should try to encourage the people close to us to develop interests. I think cutting off from social media has been incredibly beneficial to me, so that's a good start I suppose. \nI think we should encourage younger people to do that, and to start engaging with art, literature, STEM stuff, or even new media. Anything is fine, as long as there's an active relationship in terms of learning and creating. \n\nOr idk, what do I know",

I cannot even recall what made me say \"ok, fuck this thing. I'm out\", but I've been incredibly lucky to have made this choice, especially considering how immature I was at the age. \n\nBut I have younger siblings who haven't done it and it's just sad to see how they're growing up. Without entering into details, one risks becoming a crypto bro for the sole purpose of wanting to become a millionaire quickly, and the other is only interested in partying and going shopping. None of them have actual interests apart from these (if you can call them interests). They don't have life plans, apart from not wanting to go to university (something that really saddens me, because without a university degree or personal knowledge you'll probably end up in a job that barely pays rent, and I'm working really hard to try to convince them that university is worth it and to try to help them develop interests, because I know people who haven't gone to university and it's been horrible for them so far)\n\nNow, I think that in truth this problem is greatly exaggerated in Italy (I'm Italian, for those of you who didn't know that) by the simple fact that the scholastic system is so incredibly shitty before university. I won't enter into details, but suffice to say that I could count on the fingers of one hand, out of tens of people I knew in HS, all the people who had actual interests outside HS that were either artistic or academic in nature, so to say.\n\nBut still, it remains a truth that you just cannot develop any culture, any knowledge, or any interests by yourself in a society where pretty much the entirety of the media (social Media, music, tv shows, etc) is focused on vomiting constant low quality content that idolizes wealth for wealth's sake and that's it. And that's fucking sad.\n\nPersonally, I think I have always managed to have some interests, but I got lucky. My mom liked to read, so when I was 6-7 she encouraged me to start reading books. When I was 9 I went to a book Fair with my grandpa, and he bought me a book about the solar system and space, despite me wanting some dumb shit. I fell in love with that book and science. Then I fell in love with tech and programming. And again, just when I could've fallen into the path of the crypto bro (since I was a tech bro already), I met a girl who was a communist, and I started getting interested in politics. I have always been curious and always had interests because I had people who supported me and directed me in one way or the other. And I think that if my parents had done that more closely since middle school, I would be miles ahead of where I am now. But nonetheless, I have interests because I got lucky. And this is really a tragedy, because people who are left a bit to themselves do not develop interests because current media doesn't help you at all in that regard, despite all the fancy corporate posturing.",

And I grew up with that and the previous generation also did, to a certain extent. \nThen came social media and its shitty trends, the obsession with appearances and that sort of stuff (plus social media itself acting as an echo chamber for conspiracy theorists and an all around toxic environment), which I luckily managed to not be drawn into by deciding at 14 to stop using Facebook (which I think has been one of the best decisions of my entire life and I'll forever be grateful to 14 year old me for making this choice).\nAnd then came these shitty, idiotic Twitch streamers and the TikTok stars who I think have managed to hit new lows in their obsession with wealth while being the most annoying morons on the planet.\nAnd the younger teens have to go through all of this, at the same time, in a society in which it's becoming increasingly more difficult to live in, and which seems directed towards collapse.\n\nI'm just incredibly sad for younger people.

Because we have some beliefs we're proud of which don't need to be masked by adopting far-right strategies, and because one can both condemn Russia's reactionary imperialism \"and* NATO imperialism. Here's a post I made on another channel condemning their islamophobia, just 2 days ago, and here's another one where I point out the fact that in Russia who protests war is arrested, in the fake democracy that is the US (as I've explicitly called it, since I called both Russia and the US antidemocratic), even when war is opposed with large protests it's still done either way (because citizens do not actually have the power on these matters).\n\nAlso I like how they took what I wrote and tried to copy it changing the words as to be cunning about it, but it doesn't really make sense both because the thesis is nonsense (a quick look on this channel proves this), and because the last third of the message makes no sense in promoting their false ideas. \n\nAnd finally, when you've been called out for your whataboutist strategy, responding with further whataboutism is not very clever.

They're so ashamed of their own beliefs that they don't dare saying them aloud. They support Russia, but  have to resort to condemning the opponent all the time instead. You know who else uses this strategy? American nazis. They never come and tell you that nazism is good and you should give it a chance and genocide is desirable. They just keep promoting the idea that everything is degenerating and the jewish cabal is entirely at fault and someone really needs to do something about this.\n\nAnd I think it says a lot, that these people have to resort to the same strategy",

So the bed turns into a couch, and stuff slides in and out etc in order to maximize the living space. Here's a video of these projects in action. Which is pretty cool, but there no words on how to concretely solve the shitty living conditions that a a real estate market that has gone crazy creates. This is a solution for only a few wealthy people (did I say each project is done once at a time by this designer, working with the future inhabitants of the apartment?), it really does nothing for the average family living in cramped spaces. The solution to the systemic problem, as its typical for liberals, is solved at the individual level for the wealthy, and hopefully the poor will feel inspired to do something similar to solve their situation. Or something.\n\nIn episode 5, I thought a middle class family house would be discussed about. Nope, the guy is the son of the VP of a really large construction company (skanksa. 2020 revenue: 17 billion dollars. The guy died a few years ago, but still, must've been incredibly wealthy as well). The son took a year off before going to college, which seems obligatory for rich people apparently. The college is the Rhode Island school of design (yearly tuition fee: 55000$). He went to japan to a temple for inspiration and shit. And then he was inspired by the buildings there for his house. The house is not huge, actually. But of course, they're already thinking of building the next one, which will be much bigger. At the end of the episode they ponder if it would be too over the top to put a fireplace in the bathroom. The architect hopes his japanese-inspired colonial house will inspire (sic!) people to use sustainable practices (?). As if the issue is the lack of ideas, and not the economical viability of this stuff.  \n\nIn episode 6, there's an indian architect who took the obligatory year off before studying architecture. She said she wanted to help create architecture for poor communities, and I do wonder how it ended up for her since we're talking about her innovative mansion. She spends a lot of time talking about having discovered bricks, pretty much. She likes talking about the house using handmade bricks and stuff. You're wondering what happened to her desire to make affordable housing for people, if now she won't stop talking about handmade shit. Yeah, me too. Never addressed. They do talk a lot about the mansion having an open design, eh! \n\nIn Episode 7, this lawyer and writer wanted to build a house that would achieve a new harmony with nature. Does that mean rethinking the whole process through which houses are built? Is this in any way related to how the economy works? No, it's just that the roof is covered in grass so it doesn't provide for a stark contrast against the environment. As if that was the problem. Of course, the new house that must serve as a template for a new harmony with nature has an enormous pool in it. Is there harmony at least with regards to the materials used? Nope, it's all glass and steel, baby! 30 minutes of bragging about a transversal roof covered in grass. Wow. Also the house is not just a house, if you didn't get it. It's a huge modern mansion (that provide for an harmonious approach with the huge pool, of course). And by the way, the house is cool, but  who gives a shit? Everyone can make beautiful houses with a budget of millions of dollars. The issue is how do we make beautiful houses for everyone. The answer is that we don't. We create cool houses for the ultra-rich, and hopefully some dirty poor scumbag is going to feel inspired and start using bamboo forks and put grass on the roof (if the landlord allows for it).",

The emptiest form of social consciousness, of course. That's what they went for.\n\nThe houses they show are all projects of millions of dollars for single families or stuff like that. \n\nThe first episode is about a huge 18th century traditional Swedish house built inside a greenhouse. And it looks fantastic, and it's sustainable and shit but...how economically sustainable is it? They don't talk about this, about whether such a project could be reproduced at large for entire communities. Instead, the engineer/architect who owns and \"built\" the house is just planning on making a few simpler copies to sell. Cool. 5 houses like that. Then what? Nothing, a pat on the back and that's it.\n\nIn Episode 2, there's this black artist who repurposes old buildings for artistic projects (about african-american culture) and shit like that, and it's great, but they never come even close to addressing poverty or social and economic inequalities? In Chicago? No, we're just supposed to feel inspired. \n\nThe third episode is one of the worst. This disgustingly wealthy architect (a white woman, from an incredibly wealthy family that lives in Indonesia. And if you know how wealthy white families behave in former colonies and the remaining problems related to this, you know how incredibly cynical it is to present these people as even remotely progressive) projects these natural mansions in Indonesia and like...cool...I like that you use bamboo but what you're building are gigantic mansions for wealthy Karens obsessed with pseudo-orientalist thought. I don't care that they look good. I care that the average person can live in one of these, especially the local communities. But no, they're not for them. The houses are hosted on airbnb as a \"Luxurious bamboo mansion\". To show you how wealthy this architect is, just know that when talking about her they mention that she'd design her costumes for every event she went at (which would be later actually made) and she also designed her own tiny wooden house as a child (the parents separated, the mom moved to a new house with this child and her brother and they had some land space to have 2 more small 'houses' built for each child. And like, it's a miniscule house, sure, but how wealthy do you need to be to be allowed to have it designed and realize when you're still, like, 9). Of course she's also into high fashion. Again, the luxurious mansions are used to \"inspire\" (they actually say it). All these houses are not concrete solutions to problems. They're like a feel good project that poor people are just supposed to feel inspired from to do their own change. How cynical.",

We currently have five new worker-owned firms registered, with plans for more potentially involving retrofitters, translators, makers, and new cooperatives in partnership with minority communities and former prisoners. One newly registered worker cooperative, the Preston Cooperative Education Centre, has been founded by members of Preston Trades Council, and is being tasked to work with unions to support new cooperative businesses that their members will own and control.\n\nTo many of us in Preston, this gives a glimpse of the exciting possibilities that collaboration with unions could achieve. This could see unions continue to support workers\u2019 rights, insourcing, progressive procurement, municipal ownership, and new council housing \u2014 but additionally ensuring that local and regional economies are more democratic, by promoting unionized companies that are owned by the workers who produce all the wealth.\"\n\nhttps://jacobinmag.com/2022/01/preston-england-matthew-brown-municipal-socialism-community-wealth-building/",

The backlash that comes from these announcements is not an unfortunate consequence of a shitty minority who can't accept change, but the whole point of it. Indeed, as a result of said backlash now the whole thing has been covered by the corporate media and the right-wing media.\nSo, these apparent \"woke\" turns are IMO just a very, very cynical attempt to use the \"culture wars\" to gain free publicity.\nThis also explains why these announcements are never meaningful in any way, shape or form from a progressive POV. Is Mars (the parent company of M&M's) going to stop or even reduce its exploitation of resources and workers (if slaves can be called workers) in Brazil, Cameroon, C\u00f4te d'Ivoire, Columbia, Peru, Ghana, Indonesia, Philippines, Vietnam, Ecuador, Dominican Republic, Papua New Guinea, Nigeria etc?

It means that in China there have been probably 100-150 million unreported cases that the government couldn't deal with but could still hide though censorship. \nOf course, this is false: you cannot hide this kind of stuff. you can hide a few thousands of cases, not more than a hundred million. \n\nIt goes to show how bad the western press has gotten, if they feel the need to pull these lies out of their asses. The western press probably still remains the best in the world (in terms of quality, independence etc), but has been getting increasingly worse for decades\n\nhttps://twitter.com/nise_yoshimi/status/1478158804554752001?s=20",

I've been here for years and I've so many people genuinely fall for some crazy shit. \nNow, in all honesty this is kind of an exception, since the person in question has always been a moron of the highest degree, but still. \nI've seen self-proclaimed ancoms becoming hard-core stalinists, socialists embracing US imperialism with open arms, leftists embracing right-wing conspiracy theories, anarchists using anything to bring down anyone (that includes making absolutely fucked up claims about people they don't like in order to have them ostracized from the community) who disagrees with them, and the last instance of anarchists protecting far-right militias is just the latest example of this shit. \n\nI don't want to pose myself as the voice of Reason itself. Far from it, I think my thought has evolved quite a bit over the past few years, and often this was the product of being shown that some of my beliefs/opinions/ideas were wrong or contradictory. People make mistakes all the time, and it's important to be honest and open with regards to one another, but lately the trend has been so negative that it cannot be overlooked.\n\nI wonder why that is the case, and have come to the conclusion that a general situation of stress and anxiety from today's world, coupled with years of fights in the community (often, and I need to say this, over some of the dumbest shit possible and I do mean this) has corrupted a lot of people to the point of having them tip over the edge and become profoundly wicked people. It is incredibly frustrating having to deal with them almost everyday, but in general it is just profoundly sad. I've used to know a lot of them, and to see them fall like this recently has left a bitter taste in my mouth.\n\nI wanted to make this post to vent about some absolute morons, and have ended just being profoundly saddened by the state of this community nowadays. I think a lot of these morons will remain morons, but I hope this community can pick itself up and start walking in the right direction again, and the best way to do it is to realize that this is just an online community. It has little to no effect in real life and if it's not a place in which you can grow to become a better person, then it's just wasted time.  \n\nHave a good day, comrades.",

Its excessive ambition, the Times says, is off-putting to voters who prefer a government that does less, one that simply presides in quiet dignity rather than overstepping its role with such grandiose goals as ending poverty or providing paid family leave. \n\nI am not kidding. The paper cautions that \u201cpolls show that many independents already think that the government is trying to do too much to deal with the nation\u2019s problems,\u201d and says that Joe Biden was elected \u201cbecause he promised an exhausted nation a return to sanity, decency and competence,\u201d not because he promised substantive policy agenda. The Times quotes Democratic representative Abigail Spanberger, who says \u201cnobody elected him to be F.D.R., they elected him to be normal and stop the chaos.\u201d The Times criticizes the more ambitious parts of the \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d agenda, saying that parts of the \u201celectorate are feeling leery of a sharp leftward push in the party, including on priorities like Build Back Better.\u201d\n\nThe Times editorial should offer pretty definitive proof that the basic ideology of the U.S. media is right-wing, not left-wing. Here we have the great liberal Paper of Record taking the position that the Democratic Party is too aggressive in trying to pass transformative public policies, a position I cannot believe anyone really holds. In fact, the party has spent months scaling back its ambitions. It has failed to pass voting rights and police reform legislation. It has dropped attempts to add dental and vision coverage to Medicare, and dropped Biden\u2019s clean power plan. Joe Biden has resisted pushes to cancel student loan debt. If there is one thing I rarely hear anyone accusing the Democratic Party of, it\u2019s that they\u2019re trying too hard.\"\n\nhttps://www.currentaffairs.org/2021/11/why-democrats-fold-on-everything/",

The right-wing and the centrist media welcome right-wingers and their whining about the left, but pay little attention to what is it that they concretely want. You have a list of policy proposals.\n2) The UNDENIABLE parallelisms between today's right, including right-wing libertarianism, and Hitler's thought. The principles are all still there. The focus on meritocracy, hatred of the other, of democracy and socialism\n3) As an indirect consequence, the proof that nazism has nothing to do with socialism and is directly opposed to it\n\nI am a person that avoids making hyperboles, and therefore I use words like \"fascism\" extremely carefully, but I really think that modern right-wing's thought can be truly defined as \"fascism with neoliberal characteristics\" and will begin to call it as such",

        "message": "[...] one of the arguments Hitler uses for why democracy doesn\u2019t make sense is that the economy is not democratic. He says that because we don\u2019t distribute private property equally, but instead it is given out unequally on the basis of people\u2019s achievements, it doesn\u2019t make sense that we do the opposite in the political realm and say anyone can rule.\n\nOf course, leftists take this in precisely the opposite direction, arguing that we need economic democracy as well as political democracy. [...] For Hitler, the unequal distribution of private property makes sense, and provides a good argument for getting rid of universal suffrage. Besides, he said, \u201cdemocracy is fundamentally not German: it is Jewish.\u201d \n\n[...] Hitler is not often associated with the term \u201cmeritocracy,\u201d in part because he clearly cared more about race than anything else, but much of his rhetoric is about how those who have proved themselves superior in various virtues deserve to rule over others. (I could not help but be reminded, when reading Hitler, of what right-wing economist Ludwig von Mises once wrote to Ayn Rand: \u201cYou have the courage to tell the masses what no politician told them: you are inferior and all the improvements in your conditions which you simply take for granted you owe to the effort of men who are better than you.\u201d)\n\n[...] What, then, did Hitler mean by the \u201csocialism\u201d in \u201cnational socialism\u201d? [...] In one curious passage, he defines it this way: \u201cHe who has taken to heart the meaning of our great song \u2018Deutschland, Deutschland, uber alles,\u2019 that nothing in the world stands for him higher than this Germany, people and land, land and people, he is a Socialist!\u201d Hitler\u2019s \u201csocialism,\u201d then, was mostly just a vague restatement of his nationalism. It certainly had nothing to do with the class struggle that most socialists believe is important. \u201cI reject the word \u2018proletariat,\u2019\u201d he says, calling it a Jewish term. Hitler says the whole idea of a class struggle is Marxist Jewish nonsense, and \u201cwe must on principle free ourselves from any class standpoint,\u201d\n\nGeorge Orwell, in his review of Mein Kampf, pointed out that Hitler\u2019s appeal was quite obvious, even though his doctrine was wholly unappealing and miserable: \n    \u201cWhat he envisages, a hundred years hence, is\u2026 a horrible brainless empire in which, essentially, nothing ever happens except the training of young men for war and the endless breeding of fresh cannon-fodder. How was it that he was able to put this monstrous vision across?\u2026 The fact is that there is something deeply appealing about him. One feels it again when one sees his photographs\u2026 In a rather more manly way it reproduces the expression of innumerable pictures of Christ crucified, and there is little doubt that that is how Hitler sees himself. The initial, personal cause of his grievance against the universe can only be guessed at; but at any rate the grievance is here. He is the martyr, the victim, Prometheus chained to the rock, the self-sacrificing hero who fights single-handed against impossible odds. If he were killing a mouse he would know how to make it seem like a dragon. One feels, as with Napoleon, that he is fighting against destiny, that he can\u2019t win, and yet that he somehow deserves to. The attraction of such a pose is of course enormous; half the films that one sees turn upon some such theme.\u201d\n\nFrom reading Hitler closely, then, we can see that the intellectual foundations of his horrifying project have not yet been eradicated. Nationalism, anti-egalitarianism, and militarism are still with us. So is anti-Semitism. The disturbing thing about reading Hitler\u2019s writings is realizing how similar they are to a great deal of contemporary rhetoric, and how effective these arguments can be in the right historical circumstances when made by a skilled enough demagogue.\n\nwww.currentaffairs.org/2021/10/the-echoes-of-hitler/",

He explains very clearly that while leftists believe people are equal, and that they have a right to rule by virtue of their humanity, he rejects \u201cloathsome humanitarian morality\u201d and believes in rule by natural superiors: \n\n\u201cThe Jewish doctrine of Marxism rejects the aristocratic principle of Nature and replaces the eternal privilege of power and strength by the mass of numbers and their dead weight. Thus it denies the value of personality in man, contests the significance of nationality and race, and thereby withdraws from humanity the premise of its existence and its culture\u2026\u201d",

Most people in our society do not have a basic understanding of feminism; they cannot acquire  that understanding  from  a  wealth  of diverse  material, \ngrade  school-level primers,  and so  on, because  this  material  does not exist.  We must create it if we are  to rebuild feminist movement that is  truly for everyone. \nFeminist advocates have not organized resources to ensure that \nwe have television  stations  or consistent spots  on any  existing stations.  There is  no  feminist  news  hour  on any  television  or radio show.\"\n\nFeminism is for everybody, by Bell Hooks",

        "message": "\"What is remarkable fifty years later is the extent to which the real world has disappeared from our discussions of conspiracy theories. We have replaced social and economic conditions with cognitive deficiencies, ancient mythologies with logical fallacies, history with atavistic biases. It is not just that we have projected the causes of conspiracism deep into the recesses of the human brain; we assume that these depths are easier to know than the world that surrounds us and more amenable to reform. The champions of debunking and the new information vigilantes are not interested in entertaining the possibility that the root cause of conspiracy theories may be located outside the mind and may require a reexamination of our economic and social arrangements. For them, the world is fine as it is; it is all a matter of bringing people in alignment with a reality which they fail to appreciate. Steven Pinker, one of the paladins of truth and rationality, suggests implementing nothing less than \u201cdebiasing\u201d programs that would help individuals see that there is nothing wrong with the world and that everything will be okay if we let those in charge take care of it. The imperative is to adapt to a world given a free pass and avoid the temptation of meddling with it. Debunking ultimately turns out to be a defense of the status quo\u2014not because conspiracy theories may be true, but because it uses them to further restrict the space for politics.\"\n\nhttps://bostonreview.net/politics/nicolas-guilhot-bad-information",

Rupert Murdoch got his dose at the first possible moment. Steve Doocy, Ainsley Earhardt, Brian Kilmeade, and Mark Levin all got their shots. Tucker Carlson's angry refusal to say whether or not he did speaks for itself. The Fox headquarters even has a requirement that all staff disclose their vaccination status, and the unvaccinated have to wear masks and submit to daily health checks.\n\nNow, this is not to say that all the top conservative elite are cynical liars who don't believe the right-wing propaganda they espouse. Their level of genuine belief varies between hosts and topics \u2014 Carlson, I'll wager, knows perfectly well he is spreading lies about the vaccine, but he also gives every sign of being a committed white supremacist. Sean Hannity also knows the vaccines works and has said so, but he can't bear his viewers yelling at him for a single second. Doocy, meanwhile, seems to be the network's lone voice unequivocally advocating for vaccines. \n\nBy the same token, it's hard to know why exactly lower-ranking conservative radio guys didn't follow Doocy's advice. It could be the different social context of being an ultra-rich celebrity in New York, and therefore seeing personally thousands of people who got the vaccine with no ill effects, versus being in a conservative backwater where liberals are less present. It could just be that radio guys are more addicted to their own propaganda, or spend more time in the fever swamps of Facebook ivermectin groups.\"\n\nhttps://theweek.com/politics/1004828/how-conservatism-is-killing-its-own-radio-hosts",

Indeed, there would be nothing \u201cspecifically socialist about [it].\u201d\"\n\nOn racism:\"Marx copied George\u2019s observation that \u201ccommunism or socialism \u201dhad failed to win the support of most workers, because \u201cthe presence of the Chinese ha[d] largely engrossed the attention of the labouring classes, offering what has seemed to them a sufficient explanation of the fall of wages and difficulty of finding employment.\u201d Marx was well aware that conflicts among workers, particularly after waves of migration, were a powerful weapon that the bourgeoisie could use to distract them from the real problems of capitalist society.\"\n\nOn Communism and Socialism: \n\nMarx understood communism as \"a higher form of society, a society in which the full and free development of every individual forms the ruling principle.\"\n\n\"Marx carefully avoided formulations that might suggest a universal model of socialist society [...]. This is why [...] he intimated that \u201cwriting recipes for the cook-shops of the future\u201d was by no means one of his interests, and why in 1879\u20131880 [...] he wrote categorically: \u201cI have never established a \u2018socialist system.\u2019\u201d\"\n\nOn the idea that a country needs to go through fixed stages of development to bring about a socialist society:\n\u201cevents of striking similarity, taking place in different historical contexts, [lead] to totally disparate results.\u201d To understand real historical transformations, it was necessary to study individual phenomena separately; only then could they be compared with one another. It would never be possible to interpret them \u201cwith the master-key of a general historico-philosophical theory, whose supreme virtue consists in being supra-historical.\u201d\"\n\n\"a key conclusion that Marx reached: hypotheses about the possible course of history should not base themselves on abstract laws but always be commensurate with the diversity of existing contexts. [...] Guided by doubt and hostility toward past schematism and new dogmatisms arising in his name, he thought it possible that the revolution would break out in conditions and forms that he had never considered before. The future was in the hands of the working class and depended on the capacity of its organizations and struggles to bring about profound social upheavals\"\n\n- The Last Years of Karl Marx, Marcello Musto\n\nThe book also talks about other subjects, in particular Marx's condemnation of colonialism and imperialism in his trip to Algiers",

But they don't really care about history, about culture, about art, about anything. They don't. It's just that this is how they can hide their hideous idea. They'll talk about how we need to protect science and then they're against science the second it disagrees with their shitty ideas. They'll talk about culture and have NONE- They listen to classical music just because it makes them think \"oh, I'm listening to classical music, not rap. I am so smart and superior\". And the second you talk to them about their 'interests' it's just some vague interest in some famous work. They don't have any knowledge about anything. They don't like Leonardo because they have an appreciation for art or whatever, but because his works are symbols they can use to promote their agenda. All of their interests are just masks. Every musical composition, every statue, every painting, every written work is a Trojan Horse. It's always hiding their agenda. The horse, in reality, is empty.",

They are also massive fans of declaring that they have \u201cfacts\u201d and that their analysis is \u201cunbiased.\u201d\n\nThe men interviewed in the piece, once sweet and caring, started changing after going down a rabbit hole of extremist political content on YouTube and involving themselves in radical right-wing online communities. Convinced of their absolute correctness, these men became at first frustrated, then verbally abusive once they realized their female partners did not always agree with their new views. Any dialogue attempted by these men was not made \u2014 at least as far as their partners could tell \u2014 with the goal of exchanging views and opening themselves to being challenged. Their goal was to assert their beliefs as fact; to teach their partner the truth, as a Christian missionary might put it. Every woman interviewed in the article \u2014 including those who were more formally educated than their boyfriends \u2014 makes reference to their former partners belittling their intelligence and rationality. These men were certain that they were the smart ones, that they had correctly assessed the \u201cfacts\u201d with \u201clogic,\u201d and that if their womenfolk did not accept this without question, they were simply too dumb to understand.\n\nThis might not seem surprising at first \u2014 when it comes to contentious beliefs, it\u2019s not uncommon for people to act as though their view is the inherently superior one. But what\u2019s remarkable is how ridiculously confident these men became, in a relatively short time, in their unique philosopher-king-like possession of objective truth and superior analysis\u2026 all while copying their arguments from an echo-chamber of poorly cited webcam videos and anonymous internet comments.\"\n\nhttps://theoutline.com/post/7083/the-magical-thinking-of-guys-who-love-logic",

And, most of all, you would see the U.S. lifting the sanctions which continue to cause so much harm to the Cuban people.\"\n\nhttps://fx.substack.com/p/the-united-states-doesnt-actually",

A lot of right-wingers just outright refuse to accept that climate change is a thing because it contradicts how things are 'supposed' to be according to their ideal world. They privatized the world, they promoted the free market everywhere and the global society is growing more unstable by the day while the world is burning. If they accept this, they have to change things, but this world ultimately benefits them, so they refuse it. They claim that the social instability is brought by 'the Radical Left'\u00ae\ufe0f, the Deep State\u2122\ufe0f and the Jews (\"now talk about the Jews\") and that the world is not burning, and if there are fires in California it's Antifa, because at this point far-right propaganda has turned leftists into cartoonishly evil characters that do evil for evil's sake (because they hate the american way of life and freedom and only listen to the devil and shit)\n2) This whole promoting these crazy lifestyles are also creating the basis for a counter reaction, if anything. Why would the average citizen accept these absolutely crazy requests? There will come a point where a lot of them will just say \"no, fuck it, and now I'll actively go against the green movement because these fucked up people make these completely unreasonable requests to me while I can barely survive by myself\", and the far-right is ready to welcome them with open arms [with that said I regard this last point as quite overstretched]",

First, you prosecute the criminals that are doing the damages, then you make corporations pay for the damages they're all doing, then you reorganize the economy in order for it to work for everyone and not kill the planet in the process, and not the exact opposite that capitalism is currently doing. There are so many ideas to be put forwards, so many policies to be adopted, so many ways to solve this problem. And yet here they are, the neoliberals in power saying that it's all your fault, while promoting austerity, while encouraging the destruction of the planet. You need to be the perfect consumerist to live fully integrated in this society, but if you do it then they can point the finger at you and scold you. You're supposed to be ready to buy all green commodities and shit and at the same time be ok with less workers' rights, with less money, with uglier cities, with more hateful people living in them and so on.

It doesn't mean that it's fake. Try to kill a person and the effects of law will be very real.\n\nThere's this idea that a social constructs = \"something that is fake\" which has been adopted by the entirety of the right and center and in some cases by the left, and it just drives me crazy.\nIn this case Fuentes uses the wrong interpretation of this concept. The age of consent indeed is a social construct. And undeniably so. He happens to be right, but he uses this only to imply that it's some feminist conspiracy because the old ugly feminists want all the men for themselves or something.

I can't understand how such a person can feel superior vis-a-vis anyone else. They're ignorant, bigoted dickheads, with no prospective once this whole thing is over, and so they waste some of the most important years of their lives doing this shit, and then become adults with absolutely nothing but hate to give to this world, and just end up continuing in this downwards spiral.\nThese are wasted lives.

It's something that fills me with dread. They are nothing. They have nothing. They give nothing but hate. They care about nothing but others' suffering. And then, eventually, they die.

Fires, that smoulder all year round, emitting extreme amounts of carbon, spreading more fires around and preventing regrowth, leaving wastelands in their wake, unlike regular forest fires which involve regrowth cycles. They are also incredibly hard to put out because they often require excavation of the top soil.

Being incapable of working with internal sources of information be it archives, newspapers, internal propaganda, etc is what harms Western leftist understanding of a lot of USSR history and context.\n\nDebunking of lots of Stalinist myths would take it's own project, because it needs work with tens of thousands of archive documents, which nevertheless exist, and show such things as Great Terror, famine of 32-33 as a result of human action, mass repression, inefficiency of centralized planning etc are not just Western propaganda, but real events documented by Soviet regime itself.\n\nBut to make things much more easier and fun, I want to present you a big series of posts of well made and surprisingly not very propagandist series \u041a\u0438\u043d\u043e\u0436\u0443\u0440\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0424\u0438\u0442\u0438\u043b\u044c - collection of segments aimed at Soviet citizens who knew firsthand how things were in the Soviet Union and as such it didn't make sense to hide it from them. Of course there was still an element of propaganda and exoneration of Communist Party at large, but the segments exposed lots and lots of corruption, bureaucratism, inefficiency, other problems which are dismissed by tankies as CIA propaganda. \n\nThe cartoons themselves require knowledge of Russian language, but I will post description of what the segments depict + historical context of those things. It's also could be a nice chance for some of you to learn Russian :D",

They killed, imprisoned or forced into exile many political figures, writers and activists all over the left spectrum. Both Mensheviks and Left SRs were aligned with the \"red\" forces in the revolution opposing the \"whites\" (although there were also various independent factions from both), however both experienced terror when they dared to be in opposition with Bolshevik consolidation of power. This greatly harmed international leftist movement and thought, as Bolsheviks engaged in political Darwinism, ensuring only their general line and interpretation of Marxism and leftism survived.\n\n\"While both anarchists and apologists for Lenin and Stalin often portray the Kronstadt uprising as a conflict between anarchists and party communists, this is a misunderstanding that has arisen as a result of subsequent conflicts. Rather, the Kronstadt uprising represented the final rupture between the autocratic dictatorship of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and every other communist and socialist current in the country, as well as anarchists and other elements of the working class\u2014especially those to the left of the Bolsheviks, as the Bolsheviks had adopted many right-wing policies by that time.

        "message": "Hi everyone! I recently saw an article by Polygon on their list of the best video essays of the year, so I decided to steal their idea and do my own list. I still suggest you to look at theirs too, since their options seem interesting. Mine is just a little silly compilation because I love these videos so much. They're in no particular and I only list a main video per channel, and then other ones in the paragraph. Let me stress that all the channels are worth taking a look at. \n\n- In Search Of A Flat Earth \n \nFolding Ideas makes a wonderful video essay on the Flat Earth movement and [SPOILER??? IDK GO WATCH IT OK] QAnon, and boy is it good. Well shot, well written, well researched. Nothing to say, it's just perfect. \n\n- Hayao Miyazaki - How Animation Comes To Life \n\nA video on \"how Studio Ghibli makes animated cinema feel alive\". The channel is quite inactive (this is the last one they published and is from 2019), but the animation in on a whole other level. I'd also like to suggest the other video on Alien and the one on Disney's Animation.\n\n- Marx was not a \"statist\" \n\nA great video that talks about how the conception of Marx being a statist came to be, and proves the talking point wrong once and for all. The whole channel is great, and if you're interested in it I'd like to suggest watching the video on Deleuze's societies of control, the culture industry and hauntology  \n\n- \"Woke\" Disney\n\nLindsay Ellis shows how Disney uses meta-commentary in their new movies to justify their existence, not to examine the company's past, and how such meta-commentary has adopted a wokeness ethos that is merely performative, doesn't promote any major change (Sexism can be solved with a bunch of #girlbosses) and reconfigures any systemic oppression as the product of only a few bad apples. Another great video is Manufacturing Authenticity (For Fun and Profit!)\n\n- Fallout: New Vegas Is Genius, And Here's Why\n\nIf you like this video you might also love is Bloodborne Is Genius, And Here's Why. And if you likes Ellis' video on Disney, you might like Hbomberguy's take on Woke Brands, in which he shows how many of them exploit conservatives' hysteria to just make profits\n\n- Charles Darwin vs Karl Marx\n\nStarting with a vide on Darwin and Marx, it then dives into Malthusianism, Spencer, social Darwinism and Eugenics. It's not exactly light-hearted, but very well made. I wanted to suggest some more videos from the channel but I suspect you know it already\n\n- Empires of Modernity\n\nIt talks about modernity, early capitalism, colonialism and the East India Company and its horrors in the colonies, specifically in Bengal. A summary on the horrors of British imperialism. Other great videos from the channel are The Fist of Modernity and Proudhon: What is Property?\n\n- No More Presidents\n\nA history of the development of the institution of the US presidency and its continuous expanse of power. It's an undemocratic institution and the product of a broken system, and it should be abolished. Another great video is MAGA and Fascism. \n\n- Lisa Hanawalt: Being Human by Being Animal\n\nA video on Lasa Hanawalt's characters (the creator of Bojack Horseman and Tuca&Bertie). Also, another great video from the channel and a personal favorite, Night In The Woods: Do You Always Have A Choice? (contains major spoilers)\n\n- Life in the Shadow of Midgar\n\nJacob Geller makes awesome videos, so much so that it was actually difficult to choose which one to put to represent the channel. This one starts with the design of the city of Midgar, in FF7, as a representation of structural inequity, and then talks about real-life developments of hellish environments for the poor and the minorities. Another 'honorable' mention is Artificial Loneliness (btw, the photos by Aristotle Roufanis he mentions are simply gorgeous) and Capitalist Present, Collective Future, even tho I have yet to watch it (because it gives major spoilers for Tacoma, which I have yet to play) but I'm sure it's crazy good.",

        "message": "I used a Word and Someone Complained it was an Ableist Slur: The FAQ\n\n*Does everyone hate me now?*\nno!\n\n*What was bad about the word I said?*\nA lot of words and phrases in common use are based on the premise that people with physical or mental disabilities are not worthy of love or support. Many insults even originated as medical terms for disabilities. By repeating these ideas, you will do more to hurt those around you than anyone you're trying to target.\n\nThis applies especially to insults about intellgence. Often deliberate harmful actions are blamed on unintelligence, illnesses and disabilities. People are made feel lesser because skills in areas where employees are highly profitable like math or programming are synonymous with intelligence, while skills at caretaking or teaching are not. This also corresponds with the eugenicist idea that any lack of success in society is not only a sign of moral failure, but also biological inadequacy.\n\n*What word should I use instead?*\nWhile slurs often have horrible origins, it is not that helpful to just swap one word for another with the same intent (\"Euphemism Treadmill\"). There's no easy answer, but here's some things you can try:\n\n- Think about what you're trying to achieve in the first place. Insults can be useful. They can unite people's shared complaints behind one word, as \"Karen\", \"neckbeard\" and others have. But their brevity can also hide the deliberate motives of people doing harm. Other times, solidarity with affected people is far more powerful than an insult could ever be.\n\n- Pick words that describe the behaviour. If someone is letting people die to save profits, say they're \"letting people die to save profits\". Or if you're feeling colorful \"pushing people into woodchippers\". Perhaps a \"death cult\". Yes this is usually longer but as a bonus you'll probably make your point better.",

Tata\u2019s nomination stalled in the Senate after old tweets were unearthed showing him criticizing former President Barack Obama as a \u201cterrorist leader\u201d and sharing an article that depicted Obama as a \u201cManchurian candidate.\u201d\n\nhttps://theintercept.com/2020/11/11/pentagon-firings-esper-trump/",

        "message": "2 lessons from this general election:\n\n1. Once again the right-wing myth that Republicans represent the working class was busted. There is no getting around this: the upper class is with Trump. This is important, and it's important to remind both right-wingers and centrist democrats how things stand. The working class is against Republicans. Democrats need to understand this if they want to win the next elections. \n\n2. Progressives and Democratic Socialists have won big, while the Democratic establishment got crushed.\n\nDrawing less attention are Tuesday\u2019s many progressive and socialist victories. While conservative Democrats like Kentucky\u2019s Amy McGrath and Staten Island\u2019s Max Rose were crushed by rabid-right opponents who humiliatingly out-Trumped them, the Left, nationwide, offered a way forward.\n\n- Although Florida voted for Trump, that state also passed a resolution to increase the minimum wage, eventually to $15 an hour\n- Many communities passed referendums to fund their public schools, even in conservative states like Indiana\n- Arizona passed a tax hike to bring in nearly $1 billion in new dollars to its underfunded school system\n- Portland, Maine, joined Florida in voting for a minimum-wage hike, as well as voting for rent control, against facial surveillance, and for a local GND\n- Tenants were also winners in Boulder, Colorado, where voters passed No Eviction Without Representation, a measure to tax landlords and use the money to provide legal representation for tenants facing eviction\n- All in all, Colorado had a feminist night, rejecting forced reproductive labor for women and for family and medical leave\n- Montgomery County, Maryland, defeated a property tax override\n- Oregon voted to tax the rich to fund universal pre-K. The state also decriminalized a number of drugs\n- South Dakota, Montana, Arizona, and New Jersey legalized weed for adults for any reason, while Mississippi approved medical marijuana. Washington, DC, legalized psychedelics\n- cities elected (and in some cases reelected) progressive district attorneys who campaigned on platforms of reform\n- The Squad got reelected along with Medicare for All champion Pramila Jayapal and Green New Deal cosponsor Ed Markey\n- Los Angeles County passed Measure J, which sets aside 10 percent of county-generated funds for social services, including mental health treatment and housing, in communities harmed by racism, prohibiting the local government from spending any of those funds on jails or police\n\nIt was a powerful night for the Democratic Socialists of America (DSA), which had endorsed twenty-nine candidates and eleven ballot initiatives. Of those, at least twenty candidates and eight ballot initiatives won.\nDSA won big in State Senate races too: \n- In New York, the organization won five contests for state-level government, while three more DSA-endorsed candidates head to state assembly. Two other DSA members also won seats in the assembly\n- Philadelphia sent three DSA-endorsed candidates to state government\n- Minnesota also gained a socialist state senator\n- In Western Montana, DSA helped send Danny Tenenbaum to the statehouse\n\nThere are now demo\u00adc\u00adra\u00adt\u00adic social\u00adist cau\u00adcus\u00ades in 15 state\u00adhous\u00ades. \n\nDSA also won many local races as well. \n\n\"DSA-backed can\u00addi\u00addates suc\u00adceed for a few main rea\u00adsons: They cam\u00adpaign on actu\u00adal poli\u00adcies, pro\u00adgrams that would improve the qual\u00adi\u00adty of life for work\u00ading peo\u00adple all over this coun\u00adtry. While it\u2019s clear that most DSA vic\u00adto\u00adries have been in big cities or more lib\u00ader\u00adal states thus far, it\u2019s impor\u00adtant that we don\u2019t dis\u00adcount the incred\u00adi\u00adble orga\u00adniz\u00ading hap\u00adpen\u00ading in the South and in rur\u00adal areas. DSA\u2019s ide\u00adol\u00ado\u00adgy, focused on a soci\u00adety that works for all of us instead of the wealthy few, is far more inspir\u00ading to young and work\u00ading peo\u00adple\"  (source)",

I know it can be quite overwhelming. \n\nWith that said, it's now become clear to everyone that Trump's plan is to try to steal the election in the face of the slim majority that Biden has pretty much everywhere (because of course corpocrats had to risk losing the easiest election ever). He's trying this by promoting false conspiracy theories, that his desperate base needs because as you've seen these morons really thought they were going to win this, and attempting in any way to stop the vote counting (which is something that you wouldn't be doing if you thought you were winning. Just saying). He's also trying to derail the elections as much as possible and have his voters regard it as illegitimate.\n\nHere's a list of posts on this topic, if you want to remain informed (tap on the link and it'll bring you to the post we've already sent):\n- Trump campaign's lawsuit in Nevada\n- Trump campaign's lawsuits in Michigan, Georgia, Wisconsin\n- Trump campaign's lawsuits in Pennsylvania\n\n- Republicans' voter purges in Georgia\n- Donald Trump and the GOP Are Trying to Steal the Election (with examples from all over the country)\n- Missing Ballots 'lost' by the USPS \n\nNow, turning to the Democrats:\n- A Lot Went Wrong for Democrats on Election Night\n- The Squad expands in the House\n\n- Oregon decriminalizes drug possession\n- Florida voters approve raising the minimum wage to 15$/h",

        "message": "Donald Trump's lawsuits in key states (Part 2):\n\nThe Trump campaign has filed many lawsuits to try to stop voting from happening, the same way Republicans did in 2000 to win Florida.\nIt is important to note that anyone can make a lawsuit without bringing any evidence, and I'm pretty damn sure they're doing just that to flame their base into not accepting the results as valid or outright commit acts of violence.\n\nPennsylvania:\n1) A federal case filed by a Republican candidate objecting to the process of \u201ccuring\u201d or correcting problems with mail-in ballots in Montgomery County (the county is heavily democratic, of course). The judge seemed skeptical that the process had affected the integrity of the election, and in any case, a relatively small number of ballots (fewer than 100) appear to have been affected.\n\n2) The Trump campaign has asked to intervene as a party in the Supreme Court litigation over Pennsylvania\u2019s ballot-receipt deadline, which was extended to Friday by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court. The Supreme Court has declined twice to overrule the deadline, but several conservative justices indicated that they might be willing to revisit the case, potentially throwing the validity of any ballots postmarked on Election Day that arrive in that three-day window into question. \nHowever, it\u2019s not clear whether a large number of ballots are actually arriving late \u2014 Pennsylvania Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar said that there are only \u201chundreds\u201d so far.\n\n3) Another lawsuit filed in state court by the Trump campaign and the RNC pushes for changing the deadline for when mail-in voters with missing ID information would need to provide that information. Currently the deadline is Nov. 12, but the Trump campaign wants it to be changed to Nov. 9.\n\n4) The Trump campaign filed a lawsuit claiming that observers were not able to \u201cmeaningfully\u201d oversee the count, and asking for the count to be stopped in Philadelphia (you can only wonder why just Philadelphia). A state appellate court issued an order guaranteeing that GOP ballot observers can watch the process within six feet. The order did not stop the count in Philadelphia, however.\n\nIn all these cases, the lawsuits are BS and are only brought forward to either stop the counting or promote conspiracy theories for the far-right",

        "message": "Donald Trump's lawsuits in key states (Part 1):\n\nThe Trump campaign has filed many lawsuits to try to stop voting from happening, the same way Republicans did in 2000 to win Florida.\nIt is important to note that anyone can make a lawsuit without bringing any evidence, and I'm pretty damn sure they're doing just that to flame their base into not accepting the results as valid or outright commit acts of violence.\n\nMichigan:\nThe Trump campaign, unable to produce any evidence of cheating, is suing to stop the vote count in Michigan, claiming that it was not given access to observe the counting (which has been disproved by various officials, of course).\n\nMyrna Perez, the director of the Brennan Center's Voting Rights and Elections Program, called the suit a \"nuisance\" saying it is \"designed to distract Americans from the counting process. The courts are unlikely to take this seriously.\"\n\nWisconsin:\nThe Trump campaign has filed a request to have a recount of the votes. The margin is small enough that they have a right to claim it (<1%) but big enough (>0.25%) that they'll have to pay 3 million dollars to do it; the recount can't happen until the last county has submitted its canvass to the state elections commission, which will happen sometime between Nov. 10 and 17.\nIt's worth nothing that last time, in 2016, the recount only corrected around 100 votes. Trump is around 20.500 votes behind Biden. Another instance of a desperate act by the campaign just for the sake of having Republicans talk about it (some right-wing channels promoted the recount has being done because of voter fraud, which is false)\n\nFurthermore it's worth noting that in Wisconsin, as in many other states, there appear to be more votes than official voters, but the explanation is very simple:\nthe number of voters that circulates is the one done by the 1st of November, but the state allows for same-day registration at the polls. So many people just registered there and then went on to vote. The whole conspiracy is ridiculous, and if it had any worth Trump's campaign would've filed a lawsuit about it (because it's a serious accusation), but they didn't even bother, because every court would dismiss that.\n\nGeorgia:\nThe Trump campaign and the Georgia GOP filed a lawsuit asking a judge in Chatham County to make sure that late-arriving ballots are being properly segregated from on-time ballots. (In Georgia, ballots must be received by 7 p.m. on Election Day to count.) The campaign claims that the county might be mishandling ballots, but this appears to be based on a single allegation from a Republican poll observer involving a small number of ballots. In any case, the lawsuit isn\u2019t seeking to stop on-time ballots from being counted.\n\nWhile the request itself is legitimate it's worth noting that it's quite peculiar that they're doing it only with Chatham County, which is the biggest democratic-leaning county (currently 58-41 for Biden) outside Atlanta, and the blue counties that is the most behind in terms of counting votes (currently at 87%, all the other blue ones are well above 90)\n\nNote that the Georgia GOP has already committed tax suppression multiple times in the previous years, and this year it has purged over 200.000 voters, mostly People of Color",

To circumvent these, we have developed a way for individuals to manufacture their own medications. We have designed an open-source automated lab reactor, which can be built with off-the-shelf parts, and can be set to synthesize different medications. This will save hundreds of thousands of lives.\nThe main reasons for people being disenfranchised from medicines are: price, legality, and lack of infrastructure. Medicines like Solvadi which costs $80,000 for a course of treatment, is beyond the reach of most people. Mifepristone and Misoprostal are unavailable in many places where abortion is illegal. Antiretroviral HIV treatments even when provided free, have no way of getting to remote locations in 3rd world countries.\nThe design will be published online, along with synthesis programs. The system will also have a forum system for users to communicate and contribute to the development of the system. With time, the system will become self-sustaining, much like other open source movements.\"\n\nhttps://fourthievesvinegar.org/",

        "message": "I used a Word and Someone Complained it was an Ableist Slur: The FAQ\n\n*Does everyone hate me now?*\nno!\n\n*What was bad about the word I said?*\nA lot of words and phrases in common use are based on the premise that people with physical or mental disabilities are not worthy of love or support. Many insults even originated as medical terms for disabilities. By repeating these ideas, you will do more to hurt those around you than anyone you're trying to target.\n\nThis applies especially to insults about intellgence. Often deliberate harmful actions are blamed on unintelligence, illnesses and disabilities. People are made feel lesser because skills in areas where employees are highly profitable like math or programming are synonymous with intelligence, while skills at caretaking or teaching are not. This also corresponds with the eugenicist idea that any lack of success in society is not only a sign of moral failure, but also biological inadequacy.\n\n*What word should I use instead?*\nWhile slurs often have horrible origins, it is not that helpful to just swap one word for another with the same intent (\"Euphemism Treadmill\"). There's no easy answer, but here's some things you can try:\n\n- Think about what you're trying to achieve in the first place. Insults can be useful. They can unite people's shared complaints behind one word, as \"Karen\", \"neckbeard\" and others have. But their brevity can also hide the deliberate motives of people doing harm. Other times, solidarity with affected people is far more powerful than an insult could ever be.\n\n- Pick words that describe the behaviour. If someone is letting people die to save profits, say they're \"letting people die to save profits\". Or if you're feeling colorful \"pushing people into woodchippers\". Perhaps a \"death cult\". Yes this is usually longer but as a bonus you'll probably make your point better.",

[...] Within hours, the only coup in the history of the United States was complete.\n\nhttps://jacobinmag.com/2020/10/trump-coup-florida-2000-recount/",

The other party is corrupt, \"therefore we might as well\" or \"so why are you criticizing us instead of them\" or \"ehh politics is like this\" etc. \nIf there was a decent party and a corrupt party, this wouldn't work. If there was only one party, this also wouldn't work, and it also wouldn't work if there were a lot of parties. It works insofar as there are 2 major parties that are just as corrupt. And that's true in general. This is not a bug, it's a feature of this dual party system. They use each other to justify their corruption, promote it and then if it becomes problematic, the other party exists as a scapegoat.

Because you need 60 Police vans for that.\nA bit of Background:\nThere was/is an ongoing legal battle about a new anonymous approach to COVID contact tracing being tried out at this camp which is not officially sanctioned.\nThe official rules require a full legal name, current address, E-Mail and Phone number. This is obviously a huge privacy risk, especially in the context of activism.\nThe approach used by the camp is that everyone who registers gets an ID which is also written on a bracelet, and leaves a contact address (Email or phone). At every contact/workshop/tenting group this ID is noted on a list.\nIf there is an infection you can notify the organizers with a pincode that you get while registering (or if you've lost it, probably by E-mail). The lists are then analyzed and at-risk ID's are published and contacted whenever possible.\nYesterday the city court struck this down as not strong enough without any proper argumentation, and left no option for appeal.\nhttps://twitter.com/KlimacampAC/status/1309181910590074881\n\nUpdate:\nAll personal data and phone numbers of everyone there must be registered by 7:30 AM tomorrow or the police will disband the camp.\nhttps://twitter.com/KlimacampAC/status/1309211991974785024",

They were subsequently subjected to wide range of terror, most obvious being genocide in death camps, but also policy of continuous mass murder (Babyn Yar), displacement, intentional starvation, forced labor, family separation, extrajudicial killings, destruction of historic legacy, destruction of housing, destruction of means to live and landscapes (farms, forests). This is not the complete list of crimes of course.\n\nNow guess who did all that in a very similar doctrine, basically succeeded at what they were doing and, unlike Germans who now deal with their crimes being part of their historical legacy, literally got away with it. The United States (more or less any country in the Americas tbh, but the US outdone them). Crimes of this nation against indigenous people in an implementation of genocidal doctrine (genocide started before Manifest Destiny, which was rather codification of it into national ideology) taught neither in the US nor in other countries. Crimes often as horrible as nazi genocidal practices. But not only this is not being taught, Native Americans still suffer at the hands of this state, with a lot people still seeing them as a less than human nuisance.",

Those troublesome policies included \u201chaving the Federal Reserve guarantee all Americans a bank account.\u201d But not to worry: The paper\u2019s source said they were reassured that such policies were \u201cjust an exercise to keep the Warren people happy.\u201d (Bernie Sanders and his supporters apparently just don\u2019t exist to these people, even though Sanders did far better in the primaries and demonstrated a far greater base of support than Elizabeth Warren.)\n\nThe quote that Biden campaign spokesperson TJ Ducklo gave to the Post gave away the game, in that it was dripping with contempt for the left. The paper\u2019s source, he scoffed, \u201cappears to be confused and uninformed about this very basic distinction\u201d between the unity commission\u2019s recommendations and actual shifts in policy\u2014which would seem to confirm that the campaign does not intend to heed those recommendations and instead will listen to the Wall Street whiners. How stupid of you to think that thing we did meant anything at all! But Ducklo is correct: No one should have bought for a minute that Joe Biden had any intention of listening to the left. He got here without them, after all. \"\n\nhttps://newrepublic.com/article/159301/two-joe-bidens",

It's not gender dysphoria, it's trauma because you were bullied by boys and associate masculinity with it\". Nobody ever asks what makes me feel me, what makes me happy.

Basically the authoritarianism of the Soviet Union stayed, but everyone became incredibly poor, while few became extremely rich and replaced party elites.

Calling themselves communist while severely pushing down on workers rights and providing outsourced workforce for Western corporations. Also literally engaged in an ethnic cleansing.\n-theocratic oppressive state which shoots its own people during bread riots, opresses women, murders or mutilates LGBT people, has some imperialist tendencies of their own participating in proxy wars, and uses blackmail to negotiate good deals for itself\n-an incompetent authoritarian ruler, whose incompetence is matched only by American attempts to overthrow him\n-son of a colonial politician, from a minor ethnic group, who discriminated against every other group, while turning the country into a corrupt oligarchy. Currently involved in a civil war, committing staggering amounts of war crimes. Also it's okay for him to suppress Kurdish revolutionaries, but not for Turkey\n-Cuba was here, until they started reforming and being much less oppressive, so no longer in the team\n-Sudan was here, until the guy who couped himself into power and did a little genocide, got couped himself by pro-US peeps\n-USSR was here until it stagnated and collapsed. It had some pros (such as welfare), a lot of cons, but for some reason people choose to praise its worst period of nearly zero welfare, lots of deaths and terror, ruled by a certain moustached totalitarian. \n\nLesson here is that \"enemy of my enemy is my friend\" logic doesn't really apply in international scene. Fighting US imperialism doesn't mean we have to endorse other wannabe imperialists, oligarchs, murderous autocrats, just because they are anti-US. If we want to build a better world we have to seek an alternative, but it definitely doesn't lie in all the abovementioned countries. It lies in a truly revolutionary movement led by the people and in the best interests of the people, with best interests defined by the people, and not dictated by a bunch of autocrats.",

Many arguments used towards gays/lesbians are used against ace people in the same way.\n\n\"Maybe you just haven't found the right person!\"\n\"How do you know if you have never been with/done ___?\"\n\"Well you're too young to really know!\"\n\"It's just a phase!\"\n\"You just want to be special!\"\n\"How can you be happy living like that?\"\n\nAce people also often get accused of \"just being prude\" and \"going against human nature\", or being unable to form loving and meaningful relationships.\n\nMany ace people also fall victim to \"corrective rape\" to \"fix\" their asexuality. I myself was victim to sexual assault on multiple occasions due to denying other peoples advances.\n\n\"Well you don't feel a want/need for sex, therefore there is something wrong with you that needs to be fixed.\"\n[YALCh: You all are exactly what you say you are and never ever is your gender identity or sexuality (or lack thereof) something that's wrong and/or needs to be \"fixed\".]\n\nOn one occasion someone tried to get me high enough to let him take advantage of me as well. \"Well just smoke some more, relax and let it happen.\"\nOften when I tell men I'm asexual they start to see this as a challenge to be completed. \"Oh you don't like sex? Maybe I'll change your mind.\" - and this is only one type of shit that will often be the answer.\n\n\n[YALCh again]\n\nThe things mentioned are not seldom at all, yet this is only one single experience. There are many ways to be asexual as asexuality is a spectrum.\n\nOften (grey) asexual or demisexual people who can like sexual things under certain circumstances will be invalidated even by fellow aces.\n\nExperiences of asexuality are extremely individual and each of them is valid.\n\nAlso nobody should ever be pressured or manipulated into doing sexual things, no matter the reason.\n\nOppression of ace and demisexual people is real, it's just seen as something \"normal\" and not questioned at all.\nThing is, just because you don't see something that doesn't mean it doesn't exist.",

        "message": "OK, I think enough things have been shared and said. I definitely will try to share more material on problematics of fiction in the future if I find anything interesting. For now we will resume our regular posting.\n\nSome summary is warranted though:\n-First of all, despite all the focus, this is not just about the orcs in D&D, this is about racist portrayal and colonialist tropes in fiction in general. There are still very often problematic stuff going beyond just racism and colonialism in fiction, i.e. remember sexist portrayal of women (armor-bikinis) or LGBTQ erasure, etc.\n\n-All of those tropes accumulated from long time ago, partly influenced by dominating racism and colonialism in the past, and the kind of literary reaction to any change of nowadays. You can love popular works of fiction while acknowledging that they have problems. It's okay if you ignored them and only saw them now. But saying there are literally nothing to complain about, or even worse - that those problematic depictions are ok, is another matter. Our fiction must evolve with our society and it must stop being stuck to dehumanizing bs from 50 years ago and earlier.\n\n-Language that describes a sentient race as something very close to humans in terms of society, social constructs, feelings, emotions, mind and intellect (and in most cases even physiology), but then describes it as monstrous violent and evil, deserving to be killed oppressed or uprooted, in some biological or cultural essentialism format can be directly compared to the language white people used to justify genocide, slavery and oppression. \n\n-In the light of the above and also PoC people speaking up for a long time, it's kind of funny there are a lot of people who use the same trope as \"antifa are the fascists\" but with the race, implying that complaints stem from white people see people of color as orcs in terms of violence and essential evil, while in reality both white people, people of color, indigenous people and other oppressed groups see orcs and other races in fiction as perpetration of malicious stereotypes against not even only the black people. Just because you silenced everyone except the white people and you don't even listen to our arguments, doesn't erase PoC participation in the topic.\n\n-\"It's just fiction\" is a very similar argument to \"Speech can't hurt\" by alt-right and an-caps. Depictions can hurt, they can resurface trama, dehumanize people, invoke correlations with real history. Fantasy and Sci-Fi are incredibly huge and popular genres with many-many works which are very ingrained in public sphere. Those are also genres being written and developed today. So you can't just say \"ignore it, don't read it, don't play it\" because you are virtually make large groups of people either endure bad stereotypes or be excluded. Women constitute half of the gamer base yet we still fight on why sexist depictions of women should not be in gaming. And the specific problem with racial and colonialist problematic is that people of color are still oppressed, silenced and experience disproportional poverty, they cannot just sod off and make their own widely popular fiction, like many malicious white nerds want.\n\n-In my opinion racist and colonialist tropes is not even something so hard to change. Those tropes are lazy and malicious worldbuilding. If your setting cannot function without them it's probably bad. And there is a lot of proposals how to improve them. Most settings in both fiction and games can really do without racism and colonialism. The changes needed are almost always superficial but would really make those works more welcoming for a lot of people. You gotta really ask yourself about virtue behind the counter-arguments, especially if they tell you \"it's just fiction\" or \"nobody cares\". Nobody cares, but somehow a lot of people will defend the right of those tropes to exist to the last.",

We still have the same conqueror mentality which is portrayed as something \"good\" and heroic in many Sci-Fi settings, in opposition to violent and hostile aliens who are portrayed in the way that strips them of their right to live. This article offers some perspective from Indigenous people about Sci-Fi and Indigenous Futurisms:\n\n\"As a writer, Indigenous Futurism comes as naturally as breathing. It is in every story and article that we write because we have always understood the role that the past, present, and future play in every aspect of our realities. Unlike mainstream science fiction, where futurism is typically violent and values the advancement of technology over both nature and human beings, Indigenous sci-fi is the polar opposite. We imagine worlds where the advancement of technology doesn\u2019t disrupt or destroy ecosystems or the balance of power between humans and nature. Even in stories where we are exploring alien worlds, we think about how we can co-exist with the life forms indigenous to that world. We think about the ways our cultures, languages, and everything that makes us who we are can be preserved and how they can evolve in these new worlds.\"\n\nhttp://strangehorizons.com/non-fiction/articles/decolonizing-science-fiction-and-imagining-futures-an-indigenous-futurisms-roundtable/",

If someone were to transpose that way of thinking onto cultures or races today, it could lead to the worst sort of prejudice.\n\nSecond, this smacks of the worst sort of colonial racisms, which sought to make American Indians, Africans, and other people of color not just seem less human, but inherently immoral. Making \u201cevil races\u201d (like the orcs and uruk-hai, as described in The Lord of the Rings, and dark elves, in D&D) dark-skinned creates fantasy worlds that are structured along racist lines\u2014and mimicking those that plague us in the real world. It would be foolish to explain that away as mere coincidence. Whether the creators did it intentionally or not, their worlds are loaded with the idea at the core of white-supremacy: that having dark skin is bad.\"\n\nhttps://www.publicmedievalist.com/race-fantasy-genre/",

I am trying to find more general material on fantasy, but today I'll share many important takes and some articles which focus more on D&D. I urge you to read them all, especially if you are a fantasy or tabletop games nerd (the takes also concern sci-fi since they share many of the same tropes). It's nigh time we started changing those genres and games, and make them better, more creative, nuanced and interesting without the need for lazy racist bullshit tropes.

I didn\u2019t get too far with that, but still said many things I regret today VERY much. Racism, homophobia, transphobia, extreme elitism, misogyny, anti-sjw stuff, you name it. I knowingly associated with people who were even worse. I am very sorry for all of that...\nGetting out was probably easier than in general because I myself was closeted queer and transgender person (it\u2019s kind of weird to sit with people who would hate you with passion if they knew). And despite being in an extremely hateful environment I still kept some sense of justice. So when people around me started being hateful, beyond that can be half-arsedly explained as being ironic jokes and muh free speech, I jumped ship. It took me some time to return to my senses too.\nBut the point is, I myself experienced how this works. I was lucky to jump out relatively early and easily, but I saw other people being totally consumed by it. And I myself was sucked in because I was a lonely self-hating queerish weirdo, bullied by peers and abused by parents. And those people offered something - a community with little to no preconditions to join. You only had to tolerate the more hateful elements. A bait many people took and got hooked. And then the brainwashing began. This is not to justify any of the things I\u2019ve said, but to explain how this happens on a real experience. You really should watch the video.\n\nNow, a lot of time has passed. I am now an open furry, transfemme, pansexual, anti-capitalist anarchist who dabbles in witchcraft a little. But there are pages in my bio I cannot erase, all I can do is regret and hope people will forgive, while I try to make the world even just a little better place, not only to make up for my mistakes, but because that is something I truly believe. Stay safe and stay strong, but remember that not everyone is strong and they need guidance and help, otherwise the right wing will be there to bait them into their whirlwind of hate.",

Rent situation must be put in place and not only in U.S. but worldwide, it's just getting more and more ridiculous the more leeway landlords get to drive up the housing prices and extort people of most their income. I am just wary of much enthusiasm and political demonstration being thrown around, instead of really putting all possible effort into mutual aid and safety net organizing. Current crisis might give some room to fight, however don't expect landlords and their patrons in the system to just roll over and forget all of this or accept change which forces them to actually work for a day. There will be great pushback, sooner or later, and you better be prepared for it. And that's if enthusiasm is not overrated, in which case many people will just back down and not act on actually mass striking rent, instead settling for a bit of political demonstration. I've experienced firsthand the situations where leftist groups demonstrated but not actually acted or guaranteed even a bit of safety for people they are attempting to bring to their cause or proclaim support for (my own experience being absolutely no one willing to help when I was threatened with homelessness and deportation). I hope this does not happen with the Rent Strike. And this is my bit of a warning on overblown enthusiasm and no safety net situation, which could backfire in several different ways.",

Winning the majority will be hard, but doable. \n\nWe must understand that the whole Democratic establishment is poised to not let Bernie win at any cost. Warren is a spoiler candidate, corporate media targets Bernie at all levels, establishment is scared, so are the money behind the establishment. The amount of resources spent, the strategic drop-outs and endorsements, the disinformation campaign perfectly show this.\n\nBut Bernie has people behind him. And people can win this, even facing all might of corporate establishment behind DP. That is why I urge you, if you still didn\u2019t and you do not have anything better to do, to volunteer for Bernie\u2019s campaign. Even if you\u2019re not American citizen or resident you still can participate, if not out of solidarity with fellow American workers, then at least think about global repercussions of American elections. \n\nThis DOES matter, as during the course of our own volunteering we managed to text or call hundreds of people and get dozens upon dozens of people to get out and vote for Bernie, who otherwise would either stay at home or make an uninformed choice, dictated by corporate media. And this is done by just a couple of people in span of a week.\n\nWe posted links before for both Russian-speaking subscribers and international ones:\nhttps://vk.com/@leftlasagna-gaid-po-tomu-kak-sovershat-zvonki-za-kampaniu-berni-sandersa\nhttps://vk.com/@leftlasagna-rukovodstvo-kak-legalno-pomoch-berni-sandersu-ne-zhivya-v-ss\nhttps://www.reddit.com/r/SandersForPresident/comments/c9whzn/how_to_legally_help_bernie_from_abroad/",

The 26-room mansion features a 75-foot swimming pool, a five-bedroom guest house, a tennis court, a 12,000-bottle wine cellar, manicured gardens, a secret underground tunnel, and panoramic views of downtown Los Angeles and the Pacific Ocean.\n\nBezos and his girlfriend are also rumored to have toured \"Casa Encantada,\" a 40,000-square-foot estate in Bel-Air, The Post reported. That mansion features a guest house, a pool house, a basketball court, a tennis court, greenhouses, a rose garden, and koi ponds, all with restored 1930s finishings, Business Insider reported. Casa Encantada has an asking price of $225 million, making it the most expensive property currently on the market in the United States, according to The Times.\n\nDespite having more money than any other person on Earth, Bezos apparently had limited options when it came to home-buying. There were less than ten properties for sale in the Los Angeles area that met the Amazon CEO's \"needs,\" Los Angeles-based luxury real-estate broker Drew Gitlin of Berkshire Hathaway told The Post prior to Bezos's reported purchase of Geffen's home. Gitlin did not specify what Bezos's needs are, however.",

My dear colleagues-in-memes can still maintain this channel, but there won't be any more content here from me. \n\nThe nice one is, I am doing this in favor of posting on twitter. You will be able to find me at twitter.com/soyboyfelix. There, I will be posting everything that I would have posted here, PLUS more news and content of opinions on current affairs (since sharing stuff on twitter is easier), PLUS my hot takes, PLUS whatever non-personal dumb shit I might have on my mind. As I see it, you can easily expect more content on twitter than you'd ever see here, PLUS my dm's are going to be open so y'all can just slide in there and have some of that engagement. \n\nAgain, you can find me at twitter.com/soyboyfelix.

It\u2019s because of a US-backed coup attempt. If it was caused by Maduro and the Bolivarian Revolution, as you say, isn\u2019t actually working\u2026 then it\u2019s only because of CIA sabotage\" The professor was visibly shaken, and dropped his chalk and copy of Responsibility to Protect. He stormed out of the room crying those liberal crocodile tears.\n\nThe students applauded and all registered PSUV that day and accepted Maduro as their lord and savior. An eagle named \"Collectivization\" flew into the room and perched atop the Venezuelan Flag and shed a tear on the chalk. \u201cCh\u00e1vez vive, la luche sigue\u201d was read several times, and Maduro himself showed up and fully nationalized oil across the country.\n\nThe professor lost his tenure and was fired the next day. He died of the imperialist plague starvation and was tossed into Lake Maracaibo for all eternity.\n\nViva Maduro",

In a 2009 post arguing that all children should be subject to a paternity test, he compared female infidelity to sexual assault, writing that, \u201cBiologically, cuckoldry is a bigger reproductive harm than rape, so we should expect a similar intensity of inherited emotions about it.\u201d When readers recoiled, and pointed out that \u201crape victims are more often diagnosed [with] \u2018post traumatic stress\u2019 \u201d and \u201crape victims they know seem more expressively upset,\u201d than men who have been cheated on, he turned to casual misogyny. \u201cWe all know that women tend to be more expressive about their complaints\u2014you can\u2019t beat \u2019em for wailing and gnashing of teeth,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut the fact that men act more stoic and complain less doesn\u2019t mean they hurt less.\u201d Later, he updated the post to add: \u201cI\u2019d prefer to be raped rather than cuckolded; any other men have a preference?\u201d",

But now, Swedish news agency TT reports that the accord may be upended by the Left Party.\n\nThe accord would end four months of tense negotiations, while raising anger among the large number of voters who demanded change in an election that handed big gains to the nationalists and the Social Democrats their worst election result in a century. It also breaks up the center-right opposition Alliance, leaving the conservative Moderate Party out in the cold.\n\nBut Lofven will also need backing from the Left Party, which has yet to say how it will vote. TT on Sunday said the party is leaning toward saying no to Lofven as there\u2019s strong resistance to the deal among party board members and its parliamentary group, TT said, citing sources. There\u2019s also a petition against Lofven\u2019s government deal being circulated among Left Party members.\n\nAfter becoming a magnet for refugees during the migrant crisis and years of high unemployment, Sweden like many other countries has seen large shifts in voter sentiment. The Sweden Democrats, a party with neo-Nazi roots, became the third-biggest party in September\u2019s election, denying either of the two traditional blocs a majority.\n\nDescribing the deal as the best available under the circumstances, Center Party leader Annie Loof said the key priorities were to end the stalemate and keep the fringe parties from exerting influence. \u201cWe choose a government without support from the Sweden Democrats,\u201d she said on Saturday. \u201cThe election was a vote on values.\u201d",

        "message": "Yet when that woman is dying, and facing horrible pain, a state\u2019s demand that her body be kept functioning long enough to support her fetus can be cruel and arbitrary to her and her family, and often does not succeed in protecting the fetus. Such cases demonstrate the torturous extremes to which some opponents of abortion will go to deprive even dying women of the right to control their bodies.\n\nIn the fall of 2013, Marlise Mu\u00f1oz was 14 weeks pregnant with her second child when she collapsed in her North Texas home. Her husband, Erick Mu\u00f1oz, woke to the sound of their 15-month-old son, Mateo, crying and found his wife lying motionless, face down on the kitchen floor.\n\nMs. Mu\u00f1oz had suffered a pulmonary embolism stemming from a blood clot. Her condition was grave. As her husband, who was a paramedic, told the makers of the recent documentary film \u201c62 Days\u201d: \u201cThey showed us a CT of her brain. I\u2019d seen enough to know how bad it was, even before the doctor actually told us she was brain-dead.\u201d\n\nHis wife, who was also a paramedic, had seen firsthand the realities of being kept alive on life-support. \u201cUnder no circumstance do I ever want to be on life-support,\u201d her mother, Lynne Machado, recalled her saying. She even put a bright orange D.N.R. sticker on her paramedic name badge.\n\nSo when Ms. Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s heart would not keep beating on its own in Fort Worth\u2019s John Peter Smith Hospital that November day, it was obvious to everyone \u2014 her relatives and her medical team \u2014 what the patient\u2019s wishes were. Which made it all the more jarring when a doctor pulled the family aside and said, according to Ms. Machado, \u201cWe have to keep her connected.\u201d\n\nThough Ms. Machado said that her daughter\u2019s doctors and nurses were sympathetic to the family, their hands were tied by the hospital\u2019s legal team. \u201cI\u2019m a person of faith. I had been praying,\u201d Ms. Machado said in an interview last month. \u201cI had to be strong, for the doctors who were doing things they didn\u2019t want to, for each other and for Mateo.\u201d\n\n\nLynne Machado with her grandson Mateo at her home in Burleson, Texas.\nComplicating the case was the fact that, as the hospital later admitted, Ms. Mu\u00f1oz was brain-dead \u2014 clinically dead, in the eyes of the law \u2014 within two days of being in the hospital. If Marlise Mu\u00f1oz was dead, how could the law still apply to her?\n\nLarry Thompson, a lawyer for the hospital, maintained that the state\u2019s end-of-life law did apply, noting that the Texas Penal Code\u2019s definition of a human being had been updated in 2003 to include an \u201cunborn child at every stage of gestation\u201d \u2014 therefore, it could be criminal homicide to cause the death of a fetus.\n\nDays passed. Then weeks.\n\nHer family knew Ms. Mu\u00f1oz was gone. But every day at least one relative visited her body, which began to deteriorate.\n\nThose trips to the hospital started to involve driving past anti-abortion demonstrators imploring the family to think of the unborn child. Then came the death threats and hate mail.\n\n\u201cPeople would say, \u2018How could you pull the plug on your daughter?\u2019\u201d said Ms. Machado. \u201cYou weren\u2019t walking in my shoes. And we knew her wishes.\u201d\n\nDoctors eventually found that the fetus was likely nonviable, with severe deformities of the lower extremities and hydrocephalus, or fluid in the skull.\n\nMr. Mu\u00f1oz sued the hospital to remove his wife\u2019s body from life-support, and in late January 2014, the two parties went to court. Mr. Thompson, the hospital\u2019s lawyer, argued, \u201cThere is a life involved and it is the life of an unborn child. \u2026 I don\u2019t want to minimize that [Mr. Mu\u00f1oz\u2019s pain], but what he has to do now is wait.\u201d\n\nJudge R.H. Wallace Jr. disagreed. He ordered the hospital to discontinue life-sustaining measures. A few days later, more than two months after the family\u2019s nightmare began, doctors did disconnect Ms. Mu\u00f1oz from life-support. Her family was by her side.",

Mayo, Ireland, November 1, 2018 (LifeSiteNews) \u2015 Ireland is on course to implement the most liberal abortion regime in Europe, but Irish pro-lifers are fighting back.\n\nHuman Life International-Ireland (HLI-I) is calling for a nine day fast to put a stop to abortion in both the Irish Republic and staunchly pro-life Northern Ireland. Participants are being asked to fast only three days, however.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re running it over nine days, and people can pick whichever three days they want,\u201d HLI-I Operations Manager Catherine Leigh told LifeSiteNews.  \n\nThe \u201c9 Day Fasting Campaign\u201d will take place between November 6, the Feast of the Saints of Ireland, and November 14, 2018. HLI-I is seeking at least 300 people from Ireland\u2019s 32 counties to participate. However, they are delighted that people from America have already signed up. All participants may enroll online here.\n\nThose who wish fast the traditional way may stick to bread and water, but Leigh said HLI-I is happy for other participants to attend Masses, say rosaries, or make any other kind of sacrifice, like fasting from Facebook, as they ask God to bring about a \u201ccomplete collapse of abortion in Ireland.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot everyone can fast for three days,\u201d Leigh explained. \u201cWe don\u2019t want there to be any accidents!\u201d\n\nLeigh told LifeSiteNews that a former occult leader told Irish pro-lifers a few years ago that people involved in the occult don\u2019t care if a million people march against abortion but they are terrified of \u201ceven one person fasting against their plans.\u201d",

The problem is with the political elites, who use anti-immigration and nationalist stances to hide the real problems behind social, political and economic issues. And if not immigrants they will make other and other issues to fight change, just to make any substantial reform of the actual system unwanted by the population.

It began with Metropolitan Republican Club hosting an event with the \u201cProud Boys\u201d white supremacist group and Gavin McInnes. The event was about \u201ccelebrating\u201d the murder of Inejiro Asanuma and encouraging violence in general. Says a lot about Republicans, when they allow such events to take place in their spaces.\n\nThe event stirred the local antifa and rights activists and the demonstrations against it took place with some minor vandalism. But after the event, when around 30 of the Proud Boys were returning from the event, they attacked 3 people, never confirmed to be the part of protest. 30 on 3, those people were violently beaten, while lying on the ground. Police was there and did nothing, didn\u2019t protect or arrest anyone, just waved hands around when the fight ended. And of course the media chose to focus on \u201cantifa violence\u201d or ignore those things at all.\n\nThese people are not afraid to be violent and they enjoy the police giving them a free pass at everything they do, while counter-protesters are arrested even for things which do not involve violence towards another persons. But it\u2019s important not to lose faith and courage, even in the face of a possible increase of violence in US politics and the apparent failure of the institutions to actually do their job at enforcing justice and protecting the people and their interests. We have to stay informed, organized, active, strong and united.",

Furry fandom helped me too, when I was a depressed, self-hating and confused teenager because of my sexuality and gender identity. But furries actually marked the start of my self-acceptance. I had a space where I was welcome, people were friendly to me and I could express myself more freely, a chance I almost never had in real life. The same thing goes for a lot of people, who are in dire need for an accepting space. Therefore I believe that we must improve our fandom by any means, to make it comfortable as possible, so anyone could freely express themselves, regardless of race, sex, gender identity, sexuality, religion, country, etc. And exposing abusers, nazis, pedophiles is the essential part of the improvement.",

Let\u2019s agree on a simple premise: the fact that many popular companies even at least pay lip support to, and declare themselves as siding with, certain social causes, can result in meaningful change, and at least marginally is a better outcome than if the weren\u2019t doing it. \n\nIt\u2019s likely very true (but isn\u2019t a hard and fast rule) that corporate executives make decisions like that based on their bottom line. But why should that matter, if we agree that it\u2019s a better outcome than if they didn\u2019t? In a world where there are enough people with views that make it possible for Trump to hold office, you want any force for social change to be rewarded. Raising awareness, and standing in support of, social justice should be the most profitable, the most rational, and the most attractive option for any person out there, regardless of their views. There are hundreds of thousands of LGBTQ+ kids in places like Russia and other countries who don\u2019t have the luxury of living in a society where progressive views are as widely accepted as they are in the west, and they\u2019d definitely appreciate a gesture if someone like Google came out in their support. Because not everyone is privileged enough to be able to cynically LARP about how they get capitalism, man, take this action for granted, and undermine the very cause they purport to support.",

You\u2019d think I\u2019d at least have front row seats to this, being the creator of this channel. This is BS, let me tell you \n\nAlso, we should clear something up, I guess. It seems that a lot of people had the impression that we\u2019re a leftist channel, and it\u2019s true, we did post a lot of content that would point in that direction. But I guess I should make something clear: at no point did I identify as a leftist per se, and that is not the expectation you should have of the content here. This channel is, perhaps, unusual for the general landscape of political channels, in that we\u2019re generally closer to the center (somewhere in the center-left, I personally would even sort of hesitate to call myself a socdem), so that\u2019s what you should expect here going forward, I guess.

I\u2019ve heard many other concocted reasons (and I debunk many of them in Whipping Girl), but what they all share in common is that they 1) dismiss the legitimacy of our gender identities and experiences with dysphoria, and 2) discount the severity of the transphobia we face (which allows them to depict us as making frivolous/reckless/thoughtless life choices rather than serious well-considered ones).",

I majored in Economics at UCLA with a minor in German Studies, with a heavy focus on the Second World War. To call me \u201cuneducated\u201d because I want a reasonablly authentic game is completely uncalled for. Women DID NOT serve for the Wehrmacht or the Waffen SS. I am by no means a sexist, but any quick search online of female roles during the Third Reich will reveal that Hitler\u2019s ambition for women was to reproduce as many children as possible, in order to create more \u201cAryan\u201d people and keep the German military full of new soldiers. Having women on the frontlines was the LAST thing that Hitler and the Nazis wanted. You know what Patrick, maybe YOU are uneducated. Maybe you should do some research on WW2 and realize that the game you are creating is a joke. I call on all of you, DO NOT BUY THIS GAME. We as a community should not be subjected to comments from EA degrading us as uneducated bigots, simply for wanting a game that feels like a World War 2 shooter. Disgusted. \n\nEDIT: Yes, as many people have pointed out, I did lie about my background in this post. Please do not upvote. This post was an attempt to put pressure on EA and raise awareness to this issue. As those familiar with the Battlefront 2 subreddit will remember, significant pressure by the subreddit resulted in an EA Rep talking with the Reddit community about microtransactions. This communication resulted in heavy backlash on EA, and allowed for the company to temporarily disable microtransactions and mitigate the pay to win elements of the game. Unlike many people here have said, I do not believe Reddit is insignificant, and I do not believe that those who want a degree of historic authenticity are an extremely small minority. I believe if enough pressure is put on DICE and EA, they will create a setting that disables customization and allows for player models that look similar to Battlefield 1 (different silhouettes for each class, somewhat proper uniforms for each faction, correct helmets). I honestly believe that no one wants to take away someone's ability to choose what gender and race their soldier is. However, I also believe that this shouldn't take away someone's ability to choose to play the most accurate representation of World War 2 that the game offers. More choice is a good thing, and to want a historically presentable viewing experience should not be seen as \"uneducated.\"",

All to latter be referred to as bragging rights? \n \nThese people honestly think this is a battle they can win? They take our media? We're already building a new one without them. They take our devs? Gamers aren't shy about throwing their money else where, or even making the games our selves. They think calling us racist, mysoginistic, rape apologists is going to change us? We've been called worse things by prepubescent 10 year olds with a shitty head set. They picked a fight against a group that's already grown desensitized to their strategies and methods. Who enjoy the battle of attrition they've threatened us with. Who take it as a challange when they tell us we no longer matter. Our obsession with proving we can after being told we can't is so deeply ingrained from years of dealing with big brothers/sisters and friends laughing at how pathetic we used to be that proving you people wrong has become a very real need; a honed reflex. \n \nGamers are competative, hard core, by nature. We love a challange. The worst thing you did in all of this was to challange us. You're not special, you're not original, you're not the first; this is just another boss fight.",

More than half a million Syrians have been killed since 2011. The vast majority of civilian deaths have been through the use of conventional weapons and 94 per cent of these victims were killed by the Syrian-Russian-Iranian alliance. There is no outrage or concern feigned for this war, which followed the regime\u2019s brutal crackdown on peaceful, pro-democracy demonstrators. There\u2019s no outrage when barrel bombs, chemical weapons and napalm are dropped on democratically self-organized communities or target hospitals and rescue workers. Civilians are expendable; the military capabilities of a genocidal, fascist regime are not. In fact the slogan \u2018Hands off Syria\u2019 really means \u2018Hands off Assad\u2019 and support is often given for Russia\u2019s military intervention. This was evident yesterday at a demonstration organized by Stop the War UK where a number of regime and Russian flags were shamefully on display.\n\nhttps://leilashami.wordpress.com/2018/04/14/the-anti-imperialism-of-idiots/",

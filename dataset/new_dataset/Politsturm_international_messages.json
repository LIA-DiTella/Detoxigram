Many sewage treatment companies in NZ ignore regulations and waste tonnes of water, while construction of new houses increases demand and thus increasing water pressure to meet human needs.

The Labour Party's Three Waters Reform is scrapped under the National Government, leaving no action being done.\n\nAbout 38 million liters a day is lost from the pipes, while the capital Wellington loses 40% of its water while the national average is 25%. This means that losing a quarter of the entire country's is 'relatively good'. In the last few years there were already many leaks, with the city of Hastings reporting around 116 a month back in 2021 which they tried to spin as a positive compared to the national crisis.\n\nIn the end, the ruling capitalist class profits from the situation with the wholesale privatization of the state water system offered as the 'solution' to the country's urgent need.\n\nBut it should not be forgotten that Capitalism even encourages such crisis; not only is the government using this as an excuse to increase rates by a whopping 15.4%, but in the years of constant leaks the residents were charged for using excess water. For innumerable reasons, whether it's the inconsistency of government policy or the anarchic shifting of the market, capitalism is incapable of the planning needed to proactively resolve even the simplest problems.",

When faced with difficulty, he's can only plead in quiet prayer.\n\nInstead of inspecting the material grounds of wars, clergymen ask us to accept things as the result of a supernatural essence, and the victims of murder are meeting a just end in the afterlife. Under the cover of charity and morality, they spread false consciousness and delude the masses over the economic and class reasons behind war. Believing in some innate, supernatural aspect of wrong-doing that can only end with an idealized justice in the 'Kingdom of Heaven' is easier than challenging others to study the world and understand the true nature of Israel's violence.",

This comes after failed negotiations between the trade union and the national rail company, Deutsche Bahn, which refused demands of a 3-hour decrease in weekly hours and increased pay. Meanwhile, Deutsche Bahn upper management is receiving millions in bonuses.\n\nShould the union carry out the strike, they will be joining the demonstration of farm tractors blocking the streets against austerity and environmental measures the government announced for 2024.\n\nHere we see a clear demonstration of the hypocrisy of the bourgeoisie, with the owners of Deutsche Bajn who fight tooth and nail to defend their bonuses while calling the workers demands to adjust pay with inflation as \u201cshameless\u201d. As for the German government, if they are so in need of money for their budgetary deficit then instead of forcing austerity on farmers and look towards the elites and upper classes who are far overpaid for their exploitative work, alas such rational action is against the nature of capitalism.",

Nigeria and Angola have been extremely critical of the decisions as they want higher volumes of foreign currency exchange, which leads to some analysts to speculate that Nigeria might take the same measure.\n\nThis would mean Africa's largest oil producers are out of the cartel's machinations, undermining the impact of its monopoly position.\n\nThis underscores a fundamental aspect of imperialism: capitalism's highest and final stage. Imperialism rests on the control of the world's economy by monopolies which can dictate prices to a greater degree with a larger share. OPEC's goal is to fixes prices and production at their whim, sometimes with openly-antagonistic geopolitical motives. The imperialists in the organisation, like all capitalists, are not equal; smaller monopolies and states chafe at the decisions of the larger ones and seek to expand their own holdings. Angola leaving signals that it is willing to produce more, lowering the oil price and eroding the power of OPEC.\n\nThis is the root for imperialist divisions of the globe; these decisions, stemming from fundamental economic contradictions, in turn heighten tensions whichcan often only be resolved through war. Angola's decision reflects this law of capitalism and signals that redivision by capitalist powers is underway; expect in the coming years meddling in Angola as nations attempt to draw her into their sphere of influence or isolate her in the case of her rivals in OPEC.",

This situation has created a void of undeveloped waters which are hungrily eyed as an easy acquisition by companies on both sides.\n\nAmerica's Exxon has license to huge claims in Guyana in conglomerate with Chevron at 30% and China's CNOOC, in an area overlapping the contested waters.\n\nOn the Venezuelan side, America's Chevron and China's state-owned CNPC, among a handful of national companies from Russia, Belarus, India, and the EU, hold major oil stakes and facilities like Chevron's offshore Loran platform.\n\nChanging hands of the Essequibo would simply unite monopoly holdings - by both American and Chinese capitalists - separated by the formality of the borders of Guyana and Venezuela. Venezuela's actions will, in the meantime, just undermine the auction prices of Guyana's fields, improving Venezuela's own selling position, and benefiting the monopolies which want to pay the smallest possible amount in licensing costs. This action has united Maduro and the Venezuelan opposition, securing Maduro's political leadership and demonstrating strength to the public.\n\nDivisions by petty international law and national sovereignty are unprofitable inconveniences for these companies which truly own the oil of both nations. Whichever side wins out, the multi-national ownership of the oil capital means international finance capitalists have guaranteed access to new fields. Imperialist contradictions continue to play out, worsening antagonisms between neighbors and risking war just to gain the edge over competitors in the world market.",

History shows that the Sudanese government neglected the pastoralists and non-Muslim farmers for decades by pushing them into competition for land and water access.\n\nThe well-armed RSF paramilitary forces were once the dreaded horsemen of the Sudanese Arab militias used by former President of Sudan Omar al-Bashir to crush the rebellion in 2003 against political and economic oppression. The SRF executed the tasks of the National Intellegence and Security Service, becoming infamous for its violent suppression of anti-government demonstrations in 2019, and various human right violations and atrocities against civilians during the war in Dafur. At that time, they even worked with the Russian Wagner corporation.\n\nIn April of this year, they declared war against the Sudanese state, seizing major parts of the country. In the video, people from Erdemta are rounded-up for their ethnicity by RSF militiamen early in November.\n\nThese right-wing forces use ethnic and religious chauvinism to establish a popular base, creating a material incentive for local groups to gain from their neighbor's robbery.

Fish populations are plummeting, and the growth of toxic algae is rendering the lake a noxious and un-swimmable expanse. The root cause of this catastrophe lies in the relentless dumping of fertilizers into the lake resulting in eutrophication. Eutrophication is a process by which a body of water becomes progressively enriched with minerals and nutrients, namely phosphorous and nitrogen, which thereby stimulates the growth of algae. This tragic situation not only imperils the livelihoods of local residents who depend on the lake for sustenance (it is the source of 40% of Northern Ireland\u2019s drinking water), as well as economic life but also poses a severe threat to the wildlife that calls Lough Neagh home.\n\n#news #UK\n\nRead More: us.politsturm.com/toxic-algal-blooms-poison-the-largest-lake-in-the-uk",

Now Ukrainians can retire at 60 with 30 years of service, but by 2024, this threshold will increase to 31 years. In 2028, it will be necessary to work out 35 years officially.\n\nAccording to the Pension Fund, only 10.7 million Ukrainians contribute to the pension. And this is although the same 10.7 million people receive pensions. Now the average pension is 4622.60 UAH (125.22 USD). To keep such a figure, the average salary in Ukraine should be more than 21.6 thousand hryvnias.\n\nAccording to the calculations of the Pension Fund, made back in 2017, in 2027, 45% of Ukrainians will not be able to fulfil the requirements for seniority. But the fact is that these calculations were made based on how much experience Ukrainians could theoretically earn. But the epidemic and full-scale war made their amendments, and now one can expect only deterioration of the situation.\n\nAnd all this without even taking into account the high level of shadow employment, low wages, and the demographic crisis in the country. Therefore, it is likely that sooner or later, Ukrainians will have to forget about a pension at 60.",

Now the toughening of the articles of the Code of Administrative Offenses, as well as the Criminal Code, will come into force.\n\nInnovations strengthen the punishment of the military for violation of discipline. The courts are now prohibited from mitigating the punishment of the military for disobedience, non-execution of an order, threats to the chief or violence against him, desertion, unauthorized abandonment of a military unit or battlefield, refusal to comply with an order, threats towards a superior and refusal to use weapons.\n\nIn all these cases, the court will not consider all the circumstances but will issue sentences almost immediately. The corresponding terms were also increased. If earlier they were from 3 to 7 years, now they are from 5 to 8.\n\nAccording to law enforcers from the CHESNO movement, there are cases at the front when disabled people of the third group are denied to be sent for treatment, even if the life and health of a soldier depend on it. Because of this, many people leave their place of work on their own.\n\nParticularly interesting are the circumstances of the adoption of this law. The Ukrainian Rada adopted it in two readings simultaneously with a new construction law. However, in contrast with this one, the new military law appeared five days before the reading. Commander-in-Chief Zaluzhny and Zelensky's Headquarters actively promoted the law, and all parliament factions, except one, voted for the bill.\n\nIn the background of heavy fighting near Soledar and in Bakhmut, where the Armed Forces of Ukraine suffer significant losses, ordinary soldiers face inadequate offensive orders and a lack of medical care and supplies. The ruling class, realizing its inability to cope with the decline of morale, as well as growing discontent, decides to significantly curtail the rights of ordinary soldiers and suppress any discontent among them.\n\nHiding behind loud slogans about 'solidarity' and 'national unity,' the struggle for 'freedom' and 'homeland', as well as the horrific pictures shown in the media about the lack of rights of soldiers and the atrocities of command in the ranks of the RF Armed Forces, the ruling capitalist class and subordinate to its interests the Ukrainian government do not hesitate to use the methods of their Russian 'colleagues' to force people into obedience.\n\nIn the same way, they continue to obscure the truth.",

On the contrary, the antagonism between the two classes(workers and capitalists) developed into a class struggle for liberation from wage slavery and for building a new progressive society without the exploitation of man by man.\n\n* Rurikovichs \u2014 is the first documented princely family on the territory of Ruthenia.",

This was written by lawyer Vyacheslav Yakubenko, representing the Ukrainian Institute of National Memory in court. According to him, the decision of the Sixth Administrative Court of Appeal, dated September 23, 2020, remained in force, which stated that the emblem was not Nazi.\n\nThis decision was preceded by a long investigation launched in 2017 by the head of the Ukrainian Jewish Committee, Eduard Dolinsky, who demanded that the participants in the celebration of the 74th anniversary of the SS division 'Galicia' in Lviv be held accountable. Later, in September 2017, the head of the Sakcent Plus publishing house, Natalia Myasnikova, filed a lawsuit against Vladimir Vyatrovich, the then-head of the Institute of National Remembrance, for refusing to recognize the symbols as Nazi. In December 2019, Vyatrovich did not appear at the court hearing. In May 2020, the court invalidated Vyatrovich's answer about the symbols of the Galicia division.\n\nUnfortunately, the rehabilitation of accomplices of Nazism and their 'heroes' continues in Ukraine.\n\nThe 14th SS Volunteer Infantry Division 'Galicia' was formed in 1943 as part of Nazi Germany's SS and participated in several military and punitive operations.

The division of people into nations is a product of the bourgeois state, and patriotism is needed only to protect the wealth of the select few. The select few, in their turn, at any moment, are ready to sell the people out to preserve their privileged position.",

Among the losses most often called:\n\u25aa\ufe0f36% \u2014 money;\n\u25aa\ufe0f23% \u2014 housing;\n\u25aa\ufe0f14% \u2014 household appliances;\n\u25aa\ufe0f7% \u2014 pets;\n\u25aa\ufe0f6% \u2014 car;\n\u25aa\ufe0f5% \u2014 production;\n\u25aa\ufe0f4% \u2014 commercial real estate.\n\nEvery tenth respondent noted that his housing was either destroyed (2%) or damaged (8%). Another 5% do not know in what condition their housing is now. For 85%, the housing situation has stayed the same. About a third of those whose house is located on the hostilities territory noted that their housing was damaged. Also, one in five of those who have accommodation in the occupation zone do not know its condition.\n\nAccording to the results, about a quarter of the respondents noted that they were forced to change their residence in Ukraine during the hostilities. Most of them are among those who lived in the war zone \u2014 64% and in Kyiv \u2014 42%. A third of those who left home have already returned. Also, 9% of the IDPs plan to return in the near future, and 15% will wait.\n\nThe main source of income for the majority of respondents is:\n\u25aa\ufe0f56% \u2014 wages;\n\u25aa\ufe0f31% \u2014 pension;\n\u25aa\ufe0f8% \u2014 income from private business.\n\nRegarding the amount of income itself:\n\u25aa\ufe0f2% \u2014 increased;\n\u25aa\ufe0f33% \u2014 has not changed;\n\u25aa\ufe0f18% \u2014 slightly decreased;\n\u25aa\ufe0f32% \u2014 significantly decreased;\n\u25aa\ufe0f14% \u2014 lost almost everything.\n\nAmong those who had business as a source of income before the war, only 12% noted that it continues to work fully. Almost half mentioned that the company is operating but with lower income. On the other hand, 12% plan to close their business, and 28% no longer handle it. 30% of business income recipients had employees. Of these, almost 40% of employers had to fire employees, and more than 20% \u2014 had to reduce wages.\n\nMore than half of the respondents noted a deterioration in their physical health, and more than 60% \u2014 in their mental health. The deterioration of health is observed among residents of frontline zones and war zones, older people, less well-off people, and those who are separated from their families and lost relatives in the war.\n\n47% noted that they have close relatives who served in the war. Almost 20% reported that they have among their close relatives those with whom they have lost contact and do not know where they are now. 5% \u2014 have relatives who died because of the war. 7% of respondents noted that personally or their close relatives were injured due to hostilities.\n\nAs for the prospects for restoring the infrastructure and economy of Ukraine, then:\n\u25aa\ufe0fabout 40% believe that five years will be enough;\n\u25aa\ufe0f25% believe that up to ten years;\n\u25aa\ufe0f23% \u2014 more than ten years;\n\u25aa\ufe0f4% \u2014 will take less than a year.\n\nMilitary expenditure during the war gobbles a massive part of the national income.

        "message": "\u2757\ufe0fMarx turned out to be right: according to the latest research, a new crisis of overproduction may break out\n\nAccording to a study by the Russian MIEL group of companies (and later we will rely on it), in recent months, the number of transactions in the Russian real estate market concluded on a mortgage varied between 70-80%. Before February 2022, there were less than 60% of such deals.\n\nThis growth in the \u00abpopularity\u00bb of mortgages is due to two factors:\n\ud83d\udd3b First, the fall in mortgage rates. In this way, banks are probably trying to cash in on the increase in the number of mortgage holders. According to the Central Bank of the Russian Federation, today, the rate is slightly over 3%, although back in April this year, it was about 6%. The Central Bank of the Russian Federation expresses concerns about this.\n\ud83d\udd3b Secondly, the inaccessibility of housing. The \u00abclassic\u00bb coefficient of access to housing (CAH) calculation shows that the average Moscow family would have to save up for a one-room apartment for more than 7 years. And this coefficient does not consider inflation, rental costs, etc. In 2020, this coefficient was 4 years.\n\nThe rapid growth in the number of people purchasing housing on a mortgage in the face of a decline in the population's well-being may lead to massive debts or non-payments. A similar situation occurred in the US in 2007, which was additionally exacerbated by the floating nature of the rate.\n\nAll this is happening against the backdrop of a constant increase in the supply of primary housing. Since January 2021, the number of lots on the primary market (new building) has almost doubled to 61,000. Demand, on the contrary, is falling: actual sales have been at a minimum since the beginning of 2021.\n\n\u2757\ufe0fThis is the crisis of overproduction: houses are built, but no one can buy them \u2014 therefore, they will have to mothball them or destroy them, like in China. A mortgage is issued, but not everyone can pay for it.\n\nIn 2007\u20132009 in the United States, under similar conditions, the number of homeless people had increased by 10%, and the number of unemployed doubled due to the crisis. The losses to the economy were estimated at trillions of dollars. The crisis was extended to most countries of the world, which led to a significant decline in the so-called \u00abmiddle class\u00bb \u2014 the main pride of modern capitalism.\n\nThe same mortgage crisis in Russia could lead to profound social upheavals in a tense world.",

However, with every billion received, the capitalist government is driving Ukrainian people into ever greater dependence on foreign capital.

One day, war breaks out. Bombs fall on the field where Alexei finds himself in the company of the teacher Natasha. Alexei joins the Red Army and soon becomes a sergeant. Fighting rages and German troops advance. Natasha is arrested by the Nazis and deported to Germany. But the tide turns decisively with the German defeat at Stalingrad. Now the major offensive against Hitler can begin.\n\nOne of the main features of the film (aside from being colored and paying great attention to Stalin) is the fact that it uses the real German and Soviet equipment of that period. The Wehrmacht in the film uses real German tanks (such as Panther), artillery and arms, as well as the Red Army.\n\nMovie is divided into two parts\n\nFirst part:\n\n#History #USSR  #Movies\n\nhttps://youtu.be/t-hZam8dXHU",

The agreement fixed an 8-hour workday, a wage standard, and limited overtime.\n\nHowever, other companies in the industry refused to make concessions. The union negotiated, but the \"entrepreneurs\" dragged their feet and tried to intimidate the workers. Spies were infiltrated into the union, activists were kidnapped and beaten, and criminal cases were brought against them. The companies openly prepared for war with the workers, purchasing $40,000 worth of machine guns, revolvers, shotguns, ammunition, and tear gas - violence was more profitable than concessions to the workers.\n\nIn May 1937, the steelworkers responded with a strike. On May 30, the strikers marched to the Republic Steel plant, where police opened fire on the crowd. Ten people were killed and about forty more were shot; the dispersal was caught on camera, which was rare at the time. Neither the police nor the company were held accountable for the killings, and the press called the demonstration a \"red riot\" and circulated fakes that the protesters were led by \"marijuana-smoking communists.\n#History #USA \n\nhttps://youtu.be/x1H62KeDWZI",

After he stepped down as president in 1988, however, the uprising came to be seen as an attempt to establish democracy. The state apologized for the violent suppression of the uprising, and a special cemetery was built for the victims of the incident.\n\nThere are different estimates of the number of victims of the uprising. An official investigation by the government of the Sixth Republic gave figures of 207 people killed. In addition they found 987 \"other casualties,\" which included the seriously wounded. However, a report by the British BBC says that these figures are underestimates. Those involved in the incident in the late 1980s themselves cite figures of 2,000 dead.\n\n#Date\n#History",

The war plans of the Powers for the final defeat of fascist Germany were agreed upon, their attitude towards Germany after its unconditional surrender was determined, and the basic principles of the general policy towards the post-war organization of the world were outlined. \n\nIt was decided that after the German armed resistance was finally crushed, the armed forces of the USSR, the United States and Great Britain would occupy Germany; and the troops of each of the mentioned powers would occupy a certain part (zone) of Germany. It also provided for the creation of a coordinated allied administration in Germany and the establishment of control, carried out through a specially created control body consisting of the commanders-in-chief of the three powers, with the seat in Berlin. At the same time, it was indicated that France would be invited to take over a certain zone of occupation and participate as the fourth member of this control body. \n\nThe specific resolution of the issue of occupation zones of Germany was achieved before the K.

The court found that I was indeed battered and assaulted by Madison \"Denny\" Lee Allen, Katherine \"Corbyn\" Belyea and Sammich Overkill Schott-Deputy (formerly Joseph Christian Evans). The court awarded me $300,000\u2014to be split equally among these three attackers.\n\nToday's victory is a small vindication for the disappointing jury verdict earlier this month at trial. Collecting on these judgments will pose serious challenges; however, I\u2019m deeply grateful for the support of the Center for American Liberty and my counsel Dorothy Yamamoto, Gregory Michael, Harmeet Dhillon, James Buchal and \nMark Trammell for believing in me, and helping me hold these attackers accountable for trying to violently silence my First Amendment rights.

The regime was backed by the US as part of their Cold War strategy in Latin America.\n\nThe \"libertarian\" Milei government has been condemned for its apologism of this period. In particular, his Vice President, Victoria Villaruel, denies the figure of 30,000 disappeared and has said that the military period was necessary to defeat communism.\n\nThe march was also a mobilization against Milei's austerity plan. Numerous worker strikes in different sectors, including teachers, airline workers, journalists, public sector workers, and transport workers, have marked the past month.

The incident occurred following a fatal collision between a police vehicle and a scooter carrying two young men, sparking outrage among the local community.\n \nThe police station was targeted with fireworks and Molotov cocktails with the presence of police officers inside the building. In response, French police deployed additional forces, arresting six individuals and firing 104 shots from LBDs and stun grenades.\n \nThis latest incident adds to a disturbing trend of police brutality in France, with 16 individuals killed by law enforcement in the past year and a half alone, all under the pretext of \u201cfailure to comply.\u201d\n \nMedia outlets echoed the police\u2019s version, which asserted that the collision was unavoidable. However, a circulating video on social media contradicts this narrative, clearly showing the police vehicle obstructing the scooter\u2019s path before the collision. Despite these discrepancies, the media\u2019s narrative, previously utilized in similar cases like the murder of Nahel last June or the recent death of a 22-year-old in Marseille, continues to dominate public discourse.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Join @theredstream \ud83d\udfe1 Boost our channel \ud83d\udfe1 YouTube \ud83d\udfe1 Instagram \ud83d\udfe1 Patreon",

He admired left-wing and radical writers, from Irish socialists like James Connolly to champions of African liberation like Frantz Fanon.\n\nHe was arrested multiple times and eventually sentenced to 14 years in prison for firearms possession.

Throughout three and a half years, this operation involved the dropping of over a million tonnes of munitions and resulted in the deaths of at least 182,000 Vietnamese civilians.\n\nThe primary objective of the operation was to sever support to the communist People's Army of North Vietnam from guerillas in the south. Civilians suspected of involvement in \"military or quasi-military\" activities were targeted as part of this campaign.\n\nThroughout the entirety of the US war on Vietnam, up to three million Vietnamese people lost their lives, and over 7.5 million tons of bombs were dropped by US planes. Despite the unparalleled brutality of Washington's war tactics, Vietnam's communist resistance successfully overcame the might of the US military.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Join @theredstream \ud83d\udfe1 Boost our channel \ud83d\udfe1 YouTube \ud83d\udfe1 Instagram \ud83d\udfe1 Patreon",

The activists left a huge message at the Axel Springer Skyscraper site that reads, \"Springer participated in the shooting.\"\n\nThe slogan emerged during the radical student movement of the 1960s in West Germany, which besieged the Springerhaus in 1968 after an armed attack on the prominent student leader Rudi Dutschke. Many blamed the Springer house for propagating anti-communist sentiments, fueling the assassination attempt, giving rise to the slogan \"Springer participated in the shooting.\"\n\nThe media empire owned by Axel Springer includes prominent outlets such as Bild, Die Welt, Business Insider, Politico, and others. Springer enshrined its commitment to Israel in its \"constitution.\" Journalists and all other employees must pledge their ideological commitment to Israel, NATO, and the \"free market economy\" before signing a contract.\n\nThe history of Axel Springer is deeply intertwined with the Nazi Reich. At the age of 21, Springer joined a paramilitary Nazi organization before moving to the newspaper \"Altonaer Nachrichten\" in 1933, where he produced Nazi propaganda as deputy editor-in-chief and developed his anti-communist and racist rhetoric, which paved the way for his life-long career until his death in 1985.\n\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Join @theredstream \ud83d\udfe1 Boost our channel\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 YouTube \ud83d\udfe1 Instagram \ud83d\udfe1 Patreon",

The chaos erupted as Al Masry fans, wielding stones, knives, and fireworks, launched a vicious attack on the Al Ahly supporters. Compounding the horror, the police refused to open the stadium gates, trapping the victims inside, leading to speculation that this act of violence was more than a spontaneous riot, possibly a calculated retribution orchestrated or condoned by military forces.\n\nThe Ultras phenomenon in Egypt began in 2007 with the formation of the first fan association for the Al Ahly club. The Ultras were known for their confrontations with Egyptian police, who often treated them violently, subjecting them to humiliating searches and harassment during stadium entries. Eventually, in May 2015, the Egyptian Court ordered the dismantling of the Ultras, a nationwide network of devoted soccer fans, banning all their activities both inside and outside football stadiums.\n\nAlthough Ultras Ahlawy no longer exists as an organized domestic force, their presence endures in the matches that Al Ahly plays outside of Egypt. Notably, the FIFA Club World Cup tournament has provided a platform for them to convey their message to a broader audience and continue the spirit of this hardcore fan group.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Join us in building a people's media.

Mussolini said that Gramsci had \"an unquestionably powerful brain.\" When he was on trial, the prosecutor also argued that it was necessary to \"prevent this brain from functioning for twenty years.\"\u2060\n\nDuring his time in prison, Gramsci filled over 30 notebooks with his writings, later entitled \"The Prison Notebooks\". One of his most famous theories was \"cultural hegemony,\" which explained how the ruling classes maintained their control over the masses through ideological and cultural means. This theory expanded on Marx's view that \"the ideas of the ruling class are in every epoch the ruling ideas,\" the theory that the ruling class maintains its influence over institutions such as schools, churches, and the media to influence the thoughts and expectations of the rest of society. This allows the worldview of the ruling class to be legitimized and therefore ensures the continuation of capitalism.\n\n\u2060Gramsci also developed the idea of an \"organic crisis,\" a crisis that impacts every aspect of the capitalist system: economic, ideological, cultural, environmental, etc. A crisis like this would demonstrate the fundamental contradictions in the system that the ruling class would be unable to resolve, therefore weakening hegemony. It would also make revolutionary change more likely.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Join us in building a people's media.

The bloodshed sparked the 1905 Revolution, which Vladimir Lenin dubbed \"the great dress rehearsal\" for the 1917 October Revolution.\n\nBy 1905, Russia was crumbling under Tsar Nicholas' catastrophic rule while socialist revolutionaries, including exiled Vladimir Lenin, organized to topple him.\n\nWith living standards becoming ever more miserable, on Jan 22, 150,000 industrial and textile workers, accompanied by their families and children, protested in St. Petersburg. They marched towards the tsar's Winter Palace to deliver a petition demanding reforms. The petition was written by Georgy Gapon, an Orthodox priest of Ukrainian origin.\n\nAs they approached the palace, they were met with a hail of bullets from the Imperial Troops. The police put the death toll at least 1,000, while anti-government critics said as many as 4,000 were killed.\n\nUntil the massacre, Gapon had put his faith in the tsar whom he had been petitioning to reform. After it, he called for full-scale revolution, saying: \"Today a river of blood divides [the tsar] from the Russian people. It is time for the Russian workers to begin the struggle for the people\u2019s freedom without him.\"\n\nThe massacre marked a turning point in Russian history, sparking a wave of strikes, protests, and insurrection that lasted more than two years and gave birth to the Bolshevik leadership. In late January 1905, more than 400,000 striking workers joined with the peasants and began organizing councils called soviets.\n\nThe tsar finally understood he would be unable to crush the rebellion with repression alone. In October he signed the October Manifesto promising civil liberties like freedom of speech and assembly, sapping the revolution's leverage. The strikes ended and the soviets' authority evaporated.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Join @theredstream",

The biggest protest hit Munich with 250,000 participants, followed by the capital Berlin with well over 100,000. At least 90 demonstrations nationwide were registered on Saturday and Sunday.\n\nThe protests are a response to revelations of the AfD's secret meeting with the fascist Identitarian Movement. The meeting's theme was the pursuit of a \"remigration\" policy, whereby people with a migration background, including German citizens, would be deported.\n\nThe protests are increasingly being co-opted by mainstream parties: the Greens, SPD, and CDU, all of whom have enabled the tightening of racist deportation laws. While Chancellor Olaf Scholz attended the massive Hamburg demonstration on Friday, he himself caused shock amongst migrant communities last October when he said Germany should \u201cfinally deport on a large scale those who have no right to stay\u201d in the country.",

This year\u2019s annual protest saw widespread support from political parties, trade unions, and pro-independence organizations.\n \nThe protesters accused the Spanish government of unfairly treating ETA prisoners under the \u201claws of exception\u201d that led to the worse treatment of ETA prisoners compared to others. Even though the group disbanded in 2018, 134 former ETA members remain in Spanish prisons, eight in French prisons, and around 20 remain exiled abroad, according to Spanish news agency Efe. Until last year, Spanish authorities pursued the practice of scattering Basque prisoners throughout Spain, making it especially difficult for family and friends to visit.\n \nETA was an armed leftist group seeking independence for the Basque Country and the Basque people, constituting an ethnic minority in Spain and France. Founded in 1959, when fascist dictator Francisco Franco still ruled the country, the group went on to conduct bombings, assassinations, and kidnappings against the repressive government, which was highly centralized and repressed any expression of non-Castilian ethnic minorities, until finally disbanding in 2018.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Join @theredstream",

Here\u2019s a quick guide.\n \nTaiwan has been one with mainland China since the Qing dynasty took over the island in 1683. In 1895, the Qing dynasty handed over Taiwan to the expanding Japanese Empire. Meanwhile, in 1912, revolutionary forces overthrew the Qing dynasty and established the Republic of China (ROC). When the Japanese invaded China in 1937, the Chinese led a fierce liberation war against them under the leadership of the nationalist Kuomintang (KMT) and the Communist Party of China (CPC). Following the end of WWII, civil war erupted in China until the CPC eventually defeated the KMT in 1949, leaving Chiang Kai-shek\u2019s KMT to retreat to Taiwan along with almost two million people, including China\u2019s bureaucratic and political elite and rich industrialists to establish the ROC on the island.\n \nWhen the CPC prepared to reunify Taiwan with the rest of China, the US militarily intervened to prevent the communist revolution from spreading to the island. In 1979, the US started to recognize the People\u2019s Republic of China (PRC), pursuing a policy of dual recognition, only further driving a wedge between Taiwan and the mainland by promoting Taiwan as a nation separate from China.\n \nThe government in Taiwan has since shifted to the neoliberal Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which pursues a hawkish stance towards the PRC. With the imperialist rivalry between the US and China having intensified in recent decades, the DPP, together with the US, has been trying to prevent any attempts at peaceful reunification of Taiwan with mainland China.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Join @theredstream",

Security forces have arrested multiple protesters as they attempted to march towards the PA headquarters.\n \nDuring Blinken\u2019s latest visit to the Middle East, it became clear that the US was attempting to play different sides to secure their interests amid rising regional tensions. While in Tel Aviv, he called the genocide charges against Israel \u201cmeritless\u201d and distracting; when meeting with Abbas, he discussed the PA\u2019s role in the future of Gaza after stating that the US opposes the forcible displacement of Palestinians from Gaza and the West Bank.\n \nBlinken has previously stated that the US envisions PA rule over Gaza, despite the PA being hugely unpopular among Palestinians due to their ineffectiveness in representing Palestinians and effectively being an Israeli proxy. Support for Abbas dropped significantly, with demand for his resignation among Palestinians rising to around 90%, and even higher in the West Bank, as revealed by a recent poll by the Palestinian Center for Policy and Survey Research (PSR). The same is true for the trust in the PA as a whole, as demand for its dissolution rose to nearly 60%, the highest percentage ever recorded in PSR polls.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 URGENT: META and TikTok suspended our account in a blatant attempt to censor our reporting on occupied Palestine.

When Israel\u2019s blockade of the Gaza Strip began in 2007, caring for and providing for the animals became even more challenging. Many decided to close their zoos and transfer the animals to Jordan or Egypt, where they could receive better care. Some of the zoos, including their animals, were attacked in previous Israeli aggression against Gaza.\n \nWith the ever-increasing severe shortage of food, water, and medical supplies as Israel\u2019s relentless war drags on, entering its 13th week, it\u2019s uncertain how many of Gaza\u2019s animals will survive.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 URGENT: META suspended our account in a blatant attempt to censor our reporting on occupied Palestine.

A long-time comrade of Nelson Mandela he dedicated his life to the struggle against Apartheid and racism while fighting for a socialist revolution that would end racial and class inequality in South Africa. Slovo also supported Palestinian resistance against Israeli occupation.\n\nIn 1961 he helped found uMkhonto we Sizwe, the armed wing of the African National Congress (ANC) which would lead the resistance against Apartheid. Due to political persecution from the Apartheid government, Slovo was forced into exile to the United Kingdom, Angola, Mozambique, and Zambia. He returned to South Africa in 1990 and following the 1994 elections was appointed minister of housing in Nelson Mandela's post-apartheid government.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 URGENT: META suspended our account in a blatant attempt to censor our reporting on occupied Palestine.

Israel\u2019s war of extermination has exacerbated the already dire situation caused by the 16-year-long blockade, leading to widespread hunger and thirst. In a clear violation of international law and yet another war crime, Israel is using the forced starvation of civilians as a method of warfare in Gaza, Human Rights Watch revealed.\n \nThe Gaza Strip\u2019s entire population, which constitutes 2.2 million people, was classified as in phase 3 or above of the Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC), meaning that humanitarian food assistance is urgently needed. The classification marks the highest share of people facing high levels of acute food insecurity that the IPC initiative has ever classified for any given area or country. The Famine Review Committee (FRC) was activated due to evidence that phase 5, the highest phase, has been reached in the enclave. Despite the urgent need for humanitarian food assistance, supplies to Gaza are heavily limited due to Israel controlling what enters the enclave. \n \nOnly a few people in Gaza can receive food aid from the UN, mostly canned food. Meanwhile, Gaza\u2019s primary food support and assistance comes from charity organizations and solidarity cooking. Gazans, from children to the elderly, are queuing for hours to get their portions. This system existed before the war, although mainly for poor people. Now, it has become the only lifeline for the entire population.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 For up-to-date coverage of developments from Palestine, follow us @theredstream",

The approximately 750 migrants onboard, mainly from Pakistan, Syria, Palestine, and Egypt, were crammed aboard the overcrowded vessel when it sank. Although 82 bodies were recovered, it is believed that hundreds of people drowned in the most horrific circumstances. There were only 104 survivors, and none of them were women and children. The infamous Greek Coast Guard and EU border protection agency Frontex were strongly criticized for their slow responses. \n \nFollowing the tragedy, left-wing groups in Greece, including trade unions and the Communist Party, supported protests expressing solidarity with the migrants and opposing the controversial pushbacks and border fences used by the Greek government to deter migrants.

It has set off due to the frustration of thousands waiting at the Guatemala-Mexico border, seeking processing at the Tapachula checkpoint but receiving no response from Mexican border staff. Consequently, driven by desperation, the crowd has entered the country without official authorization.\n\nWithin this group, chants resonate, echoing demands for improved treatment in Mexico and underscoring their inability to access legal entry into the country. This predicament arises from heightened pressure from the United States, forcing Mexico to adopt stricter anti-migrant policies to impede the flow of refugees from Central America to the US.\nPresident AMLO has obliged by blocking routes through Mexico. \n\nHowever, he also highlights the significant role played by US sanctions against nations such as Cuba and Venezuela in propelling large-scale migration from the region. AMLO asserts that addressing these structural issues is imperative to mitigating the migration crisis, emphasizing that it will persist unless these root causes are effectively tackled. \n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Join @theredstream",

Rewind 2023: Refugee Crisis Worldwide. 2023 has been marked by an escalating worldwide refugee crisis as tens of millions of people have been on the move fleeing political persecution, war, or poverty. According to the UN, more than 114 million people have been forced to leave their homes due to war and violence a figure that increased by 4 million from May to October. Nearly 90% of those who are forced to leave their homes come from low and middle-income countries. Here is a roundup of some of the worst refugee crises of 2023.\n\nFollowing the outbreak of the conflict in Sudan in April, at least 6 million people have been internally displaced while more than 1.2 million have fled the country. The war has also led to a humanitarian crisis that has affected 25 million people half of Sudan's population. A significant number of refugees have continued to attempt to enter the US through the border with Mexico with an estimated peak of 9,000 refugees apprehended by US officials daily. 132, 648 were apprehended in July a figure that rose to 181,059 in August. At the southwest border more than 2.4 million people have attempted to cross the border. \n \nIsrael's brutal bombardment of the Gaza Strip since October 7 has displaced 1.9 million people more than 85% of the population of the enclave according to the UN. Refugees in Gaza have been forced to stay in refugee camps, UN shelters, schools, or even outside sometimes washing in polluted seawater. 2023 has seen at least 2,500 refugees die or go missing when attempting to cross the Mediterranean. \n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Join @theredstream",

In the wake of this year's coup in Niger, which toppled President Mohamed Bazoum, a close ally of France, coup authorities ordered the withdrawal of 1,500 French troops from the country. \n\nAfter months of tension, massive protests outside the foreign military bases, and France's pushing their regional partners to launch a military invasion against Niger, Paris withdrew its last troops. Since the coup against Nigerien President Mohamed Bazoum, the West has been provoking an inter-African war by pushing ECOWAS and Western-aligned countries to intervene militarily in Niger.

The attacks were provoked by efforts by white settlers to force the Dakota to cede their land and move to reservations.

In 1949, after 28 years of revolutionary struggle, Mao founded the People\u2019s Republic of China, bringing the Communist Party of China to power in an extraordinary moment in Chinese, 20th-century, and revolutionary history. Born into a peasant family in the 19th century, he rose to lead China, transforming it from a poverty-stricken feudal nation into a socialist society. \n\nMao and others were concerned that a revisionist elite led by Deng Xiaoping had emerged within the party, seeking to re-establish capitalism in China.

Mao also distinctly distanced himself from the revisionist direction the Soviet Union took following the death of Stalin. \n\nFollowing Mao\u2019s death in 1976, emerging bourgeois elements within the party executed a coup d\u2019\u00e9tat and reinstated capitalism under the direction of Deng Xiaoping and his successors, who govern China today. \n\nDuring his 27 years in power, Mao improved life expectancy and literacy rates and increased the number of doctors.

Police conducted raids in at least 29 locations, confiscating documents and investigating those who have assisted the refugees according to media reports.\n \nAccording to official data, there are around 13,700 refugees who have settled in the region, mainly Muslims from Bangladesh and Rohingyas from Myanmar.

Jammu police arrested 50 people following the raids while 10 Rohingyas and Bangladeshi nationals were also held. \n \nMore than 730,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled from Myanmar after the country's military, now in power, began a genocidal campaign of massacres, rape and arson against them in August 2017.

The Brazilian socialist and Workers Party organizer Francisco 'Chico' Mendes was tragically assassinated on this day in 1988 by wealthy landowners wanting to extract resources from the Amazon. As a tireless campaigner for the Amazon rainforest, which is now more threatened than ever, he knew precisely how closely environmental protection and class struggle are linked.\n\nMendes took militant action to stop the construction of a highly polluting road in the state of Acre and created forest reserves for the sustainable extraction of products for Indigenous communities and farmers. This made him an enemy of local ranchers, loggers, and landowners. On December 22, 1988, Chico Mendes was shot and killed in front of his house.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Join @theredstream",

Article 216 of the new draft constitution places private property rights and strict rules around immigration and abortion at its center, consolidating the market-friendly economic model instead of weakening it, which many Chileans initially hoped for. The draft constitution is scheduled to be put to a vote on December 17.\n \nThe push for a new constitution dates back to the mass protests and riots over rising inequality and the poor state of public services that rocked the South American country in 2019. When a new left-leaning constitution was proposed in September last year, it was turned down. Now, many Chileans are faced with the question of whether the new government led by President Gabriel Boric can be trusted with changing the country or if it will just leave the country in the same place it was before 2019.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Join @theredstream",

Hook's writing focused on the intersectionality of race, capitalism and gender and the way that they perpetuate class domination and oppression. She published around 40 books including essays, poems, and children's books while also giving numerous public lectures and appearing in documentaries. Her writing also addressed a wide range of other topics such as love, art, history, and the mass media.\n\nBorn to a working-class African American family in the segregated Kentucky town of Hopkinsville in September 1952, she was educated in racially segregated public schools before moving to an integrated school in the late 1960s which influenced her own perspective as an educator. An avid reader, Hooks gained a BA in English from Stanford University in 1973 followed by an MA in English from the University of Wisconsin in 1976 and a doctorate in English from the University of California Santa Cruz in 1983.\n\n Hooks began her academic career in 1976 teaching English and ethnic studies at the University of Southern California and went on to teach at Stanford, Yale, New College of Florida, The City College of New York, and Berea College in Kentucky. Her work was influenced by abolitionist and feminist Sojourner Truth, Brazilian educator Paulo Freire Peruvian theologian Gustavo Guti\u00e9rrez, Buddhist monk Th\u00edch Nh\u1ea5t H\u1ea1nh, and African-American writer James Baldwin. \n\nIn Ain't I a Woman (1981) Hooks discussed the historical impact of racism and sexism on Black women and the idea of a white- supremacist -capitalist patriarchy that marginalizes Black women. In Feminist Theory: From Margin to Center(1984) she was critical of white feminist racism in second-wave feminism which undermined feminist solidarity across racial lines. She also became a prominent leftist and postmodern thinker.  \n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Join @theredstream",

The US-backed dictatorship that replaced him launched numerous massacres against Indigenous protesters who were calling for the return of democracy. \n\nThroughout 2022, right-wing pro-Fujimori parties in congress were preparing to launch a legislative coup against President Castillo. In order to prevent this, on December 7th that year, Castillo announced new congressional elections and thereby suspending the existing congress until the new one was elected.  \n\nIn response, congress voted to impeach Castillo in an illegal session. The police and military, institutions shaped by the Fujimori dictatorship, sided with congress over the President and proceeded to arrest Pedro Castillo. This cleared the way for congress to install Dina Boluarte as President without a general election.  \n\nImmediately, social movements, primarily in rural indigenous regions, began protesting against the coup. These protests escalated into a general strike in which most of the key highways across the country were blocked by protesters erecting barricades.  \n\nIn response, the new Boluarte regime declared a state of emergency and gave the police and military the green light to use live ammunition to clear roads and break up the protests. This is when the massacres across Quechua and Aymara regions began.   \n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Join @theredstream",

His work, especially his poems, reflected his lifelong struggle against racism and imperialism.\n\nHe was born in Birmingham in 1956 to a Barbadian father and a Jamaican mother, both Christians, and struggled with dyslexia as a child leaving school at the age of 13 unable to read or write. Zephaniah would become an iconic testament to the fact that formal education is not the only route towards creative and intellectual achievement, largely self-taught, he developed an early love of literature.\n\nZephaniah embraced Rastafarianism in his late teens and moved to London in the late 1970s. During the riots of the early 1980s, Zephaniah faced brutal racism from the far-right and the police. After being involved in a worker's co-op in East London, he established himself as a poet attacking the British legal system, reflecting on his travels in occupied Palestine and celebrating cultural diversity in Britain. Zephaniah also released musical tributes to Bob Marley and Nelson Mandela as well as appearing in various British TV programs including the worldwide hit Peaky Blinders which was set in his home city.\n\nBenjamin Zephaniah was a fixture in the Palestine solidarity movement and a patron of Britain's Palestine Solidarity Campaign, which much of his activism was dedicated to. He was also a committed vegan and supported animal rights, an anarchist he endorsed socialist Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and campaigned for a British republic. In 2003 he declined The Order of the British Empire (OBE) in protest against British imperialism and the Transatlantic Slave Trade.\n\n\ud83d\udfe1 Join @theredstream",

While playing for the S\u00e3o Paulo club Corinthians, he co-founded the Corinthians Democracy movement, which challenged the capitalist model of running football clubs and the brutal military dictatorship in Brazil.

It aimed to create a democratic, self-managed model where fans and players had a say in running their club. Under this model, the vote of a team's manager had the same weight as an ordinary fan about every single decision made at the club.\n \nThe Diretas J\u00e1 movement, along with massive protests by students, workers, and artists, played a crucial role in ending the US-backed dictatorship that had ruled Brazil since 1964. It brutally repressed the left, committing heinous crimes such as detention without trial, torture, and hundreds of killings. \n \nS\u00f3crates was a creative midfielder who could play in an attacking role or central midfield, who captained a skilful Brazil team at the 1982 World Cup Final in Spain.

Arafat\u2019s speech to the General Assembly on November 13, 1974, was a key point in the organization\u2019s fight for Palestinian independence and self-determination. \n \nAs part of their colonial occupation, Israel has been cutting down olive trees due to their association with Palestinian culture, replacing them with imported pine trees, and thus transforming the olive branch into a symbol of Palestinian resistance. Through the metaphor of an olive branch in one hand and a freedom fighter\u2019s gun in the other, Arafat warned of the dangers of Zionism and its plan to eradicate Palestinian culture, identity, and history. \n \nThe speech also marked a shift in the organization\u2019s policy concerning the struggle against the state of Israel, with Arafat gradually considering a diplomatic approach, leading to him signing the Oslo Accords in 1993, effectively making \u201cpeace\u201d with the Israeli occupation. The Oslo Accords have long been in tatters because of decades of Israeli violations of the agreement. In the 30 years since the signing of the Oslo Accords, the number of illegal settlements has at least tripled, and the Jewish settler population in the occupied West Bank has more than quadrupled. \n \nToday, the Palestinian masses largely reject Oslo, with resistance against the occupation intensifying, culminating in the offensive of October 7. \n\n\ud83d\udc49 For up-to-date coverage of developments from Palestine, follow us @theredstream",

Inspired by Malcolm X, revolutionary independence movements in Africa, and anti-colonial thinkers such as Frantz Fanon, Seale, and Newton founded the Black Panther Party for Self-Defense in 1966. While working at a War on Poverty program, he and Newton wrote the revolutionary ten-point program that laid the groundwork for the BPP's radical legacy as a movement fighting to achieve Black liberation through revolutionary socialism.\n \nIn 1968, Seale was arrested, along with seven other activists, during protests at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago, becoming one of the infamous Chicago Eight defendants. During the trial, Seale was repeatedly denied the right to represent himself, and the presiding judge, Julius Hoffmann, ordered him bound and gagged. He was ultimately sentenced to four years in prison for contempt of court. In an interview with the Guardian, Seale recalled: \"All I did in Chicago was to exercise my legal right to speak on my own behalf, and I was given four years in jail as a result. But I think the most serious injustice perpetrated by the court system in America is the inability of a Black man to get a jury of his peers.\"\n \nAfter his release from jail, Seale found the BPP significantly weakened due to arrests, killings, and internal conflicts caused by the FBI's efforts to neutralize the organization. In an attempt to enter electoral politics, Seale ran for mayor of Oakland in 1973, finishing second and prompting a runoff election, which he ultimately lost.\n \nIn 1974, Seale resigned as chairman of the BPP. However, to this day, he remains politically active, advocating for groups that support social justice, and is an influential figure in the fight for equality and justice.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 For up-to-date coverage of developments from Palestine, follow us @theredstream",

Convicted of murder Stinney was completely innocent and was the youngest person to be executed in the US during the 20th century.\n\nStinney grew up in a segregated community in South Carolina until white mobs forced his family to flee when the state accused him of killing two white girls. Stinney was arrested, interrogated without an attorney or his parents being present, and sentenced to death by an all-white jury after only 10 minutes in court.\n\nDespite multiple appeals by Black advocacy groups, Governor Olin Johnston refused to intervene. Stinney's execution is one of many cases of racist oppression that took place during the Jim Crow era, a period marked by state-enforced racial segregation and brutal violence against Black people.\n \nIt took seven decades until a hearing was held, during which Stinney's surviving siblings presented new evidence and testimonies proving him innocent. Ultimately, the court overturned his conviction, recognizing that he was deprived of due process, his alleged confession was not credible, and his legal representation was grossly ineffective.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 For up-to-date coverage of developments from Palestine, follow us @theredstream",

Following the aftermath of the 1967 Six-Day War, the Israeli authorities banned all public displays of the Palestinian flag with the possibility of imprisonment for those who defied the ban. Instead of flying their national flag, Palestinians are increasingly using watermelons as a form of public defiance against the occupation.\n \nMirroring the colors of the Palestinian flag red, black, white, and green, the watermelon has been used by artists as a symbol of resistance for decades, while ordinary Palestinians carried slices of the fruit with them as a small act of opposition to colonial rule. In 2021, the watermelon became increasingly prominent as a symbol of resistance among Palestinians on social media following the Israeli attacks on Gaza. In January, far-right Israeli Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir told police to confiscate Palestinian flags in public places and in June the Israeli Parliament the Knesset gave preliminary approval for a bill outlawing the flag in all state-funded institutions. Responding to this, a grassroots Arab-Israeli peace organization, Zazim placed the flag in watermelon form on taxis in Tel Aviv. With the ongoing Israeli assault on Gaza and an expected ground invasion set to begin the watermelon as a symbol of Palestinian resistance is more important than ever.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 For up-to-date coverage of developments from Palestine, follow us @theredstream",

Germany has lead Europe's charge to weaponize anti-semitism as a false pretext to crackdown on solidarity with Palestine, while failing to tackle rising racist and anti-semitic hate crimes within its own country by white supremacist groups.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 For up-to-date coverage of developments from Palestine, follow us @theredstream",

The war lasted two weeks and five days and ultimately ended in defeat for Egypt and Syria on October 25, 1973. \n \nThe war started with a two-pronged surprise attack by Syrian and Egyptian forces against Israeli positions in the Golan and on the Sinai Peninsula. In the Sinai Peninsula, the Israelis had created a fortification line across the canal's eastern bank known as the Bar Lev line, which gave them advanced notice that an attack was taking place. \n \nUnder constant artillery bombardment and aerial strikes, the Egyptian forces crossed the Suez Canal in rubber dinghies, eventually reaching the lower embankment of the sand berm that made up the Israeli fortifications.\n\nWithin two hours of the start of hostilities, the Egyptian forces managed to climb up to the top of the line, breach its first defensive perimeter, and continue onwards across the desert. They also used gasoline-fueled water pumps to pump out the sand, allowing tanks and vehicles to cross after the first assault.\n \nIsrael maintained its occupation of the Syrian Golan Heights, which it had acquired following the 1967 war, while Egypt managed to negotiate an Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai as part of a peace settlement that also included a total normalization of relations between the two countries. Anwar Sadat, the president of Egypt at the time, thus broke with the anti-colonial and anti-Zionist policies of Egypt advocated by his predecessor, Gamal Abdel Nasser. \n\n\ud83d\udc49 Join @theredstream",

While homelessness is soaring in the US, in Cuba it is effectively non-existent.\n\n Homelessness in the US has risen by 11% this year to reach the highest level in 15 years since US authorities started collecting data.\n\nIn contrast, housing is considered a human right in Cuba, and rent is capped at 10% of family income. Following the Cuban Revolution in 1959, Fidel Castro introduced housing subsidies and state-owned homes to combat homelessness, almost eradicating it as a social problem.

The meeting was like no other, do you know why? \n \nA year after the Cuban Revolution, Castro and his delegation arrived in New York to attend the UN General Assembly. However, the management of the Manhattan hotel where the delegation had made reservations refused to accommodate them, following pressure from the US government that had already convinced other hotels to reject the Cubans. Upon learning of their situation, Malcolm X invited them to come uptown to Harlem and stay at the Black-owned Hotel Theresa, where he assured them, they would be welcomed with open arms.\n \nThe people of Harlem warmly received the 34-year-old Cuban revolutionary leader, crowds gathering round-the-clock in front of the hotel. To them, Castro was the bearded revolutionary who had boldly defied white America, and his stay in Harlem symbolized the shared struggle of African Americans with the rest of the Third World against racism, colonialism, and imperialism.\n \nCastro pointed out that Black people in the United States weren't as influenced by the government's anti-Cuban propaganda as white Americans. Castro also highlighted the progress in revolutionary Cuba to eliminate racial discrimination, emphasizing that Cubans, Africans, and Black Americans were all in the same struggle. \n \nHe said, \"I feel as if I were in Cuba now. I feel very warm here.\" In response, Malcolm X acknowledged that it was indeed true that \"We in Harlem are not addicted to all the propaganda the US government puts out.\" They then embraced, and Malcolm X noted, \"As long as Uncle Sam is against you, you know you're a good man.\"\n\n \ud83d\udc49 Join @theredstream",

These letters were eventually turned into two bestselling books, Soledad Brother, and Blood in My Eye, which made him famous amongst US and European leftist groups. Jackson also gained numerous admirers among fellow inmates from Black, white, and Latino backgrounds.\n\n On 21 August 1971, Jackson was shot dead from a prison tower after he had been involved in a hostage-taking. Three days before his death, he rewrote his will, leaving all his royalties and control of his legal defense fund to the Black Panther Party.

The violence occurred east of the Jabalia refugee camp in the northern part of the Gaza Strip. Six Palestinians were injured by the Israeli army in eastern Gaza after participating in demonstrations near the fence that separates Gaza from Israeli-occupied territories. The protests were organized to denounce Israeli settlers' incursions into the Al-Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem.\n\nThe Palestinian Ministry of Health reported that injuries varied in severity and were inflicted during the crowd's dispersal by Israeli forces. Medical sources noted that the injuries included direct hits from rubber bullets and gas canisters. Cases of suffocation were also reported. Among the injured were two Palestinian journalists who were directly hit by gas canisters; the extent of their injuries is yet to be determined.

However, in Los Angeles the context was slightly different and the causes of the unrest were more long-term.\n\nDuring the Second Great Migration in the 1940s, the Black population of Los Angeles  increased due to defense industry recruitment efforts. As a result, the Black population increased from 63,700 in 1940 to 350,000 in 1965. \n\nHowever, the white bourgeoisie did not welcome the Black migration. Many covenants prevented minorities, including Black people, from owning property in certain areas of the city. At the same time, the Los Angeles Police Department was gaining a reputation for racist violence.

Many women are forced to use untreated fabrics like clothes, toilet paper or baby diapers, and many school girls report missing school during their monthly cycle because of lack of access to menstrual products.\n\n\ud83d\udc49 Join @theredstream",

Sanctions have increasingly emerged as a popular tool to undermine the economic development of weaker nations, forcing them to comply with the demands of the dominant powers. \n\nA 2021 US Treasury review revealed that by the end of that year, Washington had imposed sanctions on 9,421 parties, representing a shocking 933% increase since 2000. Over one-third of the world's population resides in countries experiencing the sanctions' impact.\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Join @theredstream",

The PKI was brutally wiped out during the US-led Cold War anti-communist frenzy. CIA reports described the killings as one of the worst mass murders of the 20th century.\n \nThe PKI thrived in the labor movement, gaining support from small farmers and had its own women's organization. Following a failed coup in 1965, communism was banned in Indonesia as a political movement and ideology. The ban on the PKI remains in place to this day. \n\nThe coup's aftermath led to purges and mass killings from 1965 to 1966. The army targeted communists and sympathizers nationwide, resulting in a death toll of up to three million.\n\nDespite evidence from declassified documents that Western intelligence agencies supported the massacres, the CIA has denied their involvement. History textbooks in Indonesia often omit or downplay the killings.\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Join @theredstream",

As a result, his students were able to achieve literacy after only 30 hours of lessons.\n\nFreire believed that socialism and Marxism provided a framework for understanding and challenging systems of oppression. He argued that education could be a tool for social change, and teachers should work to create a more equal society. \n\nDespite facing repression and censorship from right-wing forces in Brazil and worldwide, Freire's work continues to inspire educators and activists while his vision remains as relevant today as ever in the struggle for social justice.\n\n\ud83d\udd14 Join @theredstream",

Why did she neglect to quote any of it in her article about us?\n\nAnd why did Washington Post editors assign an article on an emotionally fraught topic like October 7 to an ideologically committed, anti-Palestinian Zionist like Elizabeth Dwoskin, who has denigrated Palestinians as nationless \"desert Bedouins\"?\n\nCan you describe the nature of your relationship with the Israeli government? Does the Washington Post route stories on the Israeli assault on Gaza through its Tel Aviv bureau, as CNN does \u2013 thus placing reporters at the mercy of the Israeli military censor? Would the Washington Post honor a request by a Russian government official to retroactively censor remarks which were \u201cnot authorized for publication\"?\n\nFinally, why has the Washington Post failed to report on the scandal of friendly fire deaths on October 7, while Israeli mainstream media is publishing shocking investigations on the topic? For example, the most popular outlet in Israel, Yediot Ahronoth, has revealed the following:\n\n-Israel ordered all combat units on October 7 to stop Palestinian fighters from returning to Gaza with captives \"at all costs\".\n-This was an order \"to use the 'Hannibal Procedure,' although without clearly mentioning this explicit name\". -70 vehicles came under attack \"by a combat helicopter, an anti-tank missile or a tank, and at least in some cases everyone in the vehicle was killed.\" -\"It is not clear at this time how many of the abductees were killed due to the activation of this command\"\n\nWhy, when Israeli family members of hostages are openly accusing Israel's military of killing their loved ones under the notorious Hannibal Directive, is the Washington Post smearing the independent journalists who helped break this titanic political scandal?\n\nAs I attempted to explain to Dwoskin during our public call, the aforementioned errors and omissions help explain why so many Americans have turned away in disgust from corporate outlets like the Washington Post, and are instead tuning into independent journalistic ventures like The Grayzone.",

        "message": "Max Blumenthal responds to the Washington Post's libelous attack on The Grayzone. \n(1 of 2) (Part 2)\n\n[In response to Elizabeth Dwoskin's tweet,] I sent the following note to WaPo exec editor @SallyBuzbee and her colleagues demanding corrections of Dwoskin's errors and an explanation of journalistic malpractice in her malicious smear of The Grayzone. Unsurprisingly, no response.\n\nI am the founder and editor-in-chief of TheGrayzone.com. Our publication came under attack in the Washington Post by your \"Silicon Valley correspondent\" Elizabeth Dwoskin, who slanderously accused us of inspiring \"a growing movement with ties to Holocaust denial [which] is effacing history in real-time\" related to the events of October 7.\n\nBecause Dwoskin's\u00a0article contained so many demonstrably false statements and journalistically irresponsible omissions, we have published the following response on our site.\n\nWe are writing to ask for your cooperation in helping us address the following questions, and to issue corrections:\n\nDwoskin's article falsely claims, \"articles on Electronic Intifada and Grayzone exaggerated these claims to suggest that most Israeli deaths were caused by friendly fire, not Hamas.\"\n\nIn fact, we have not claimed that most Israeli deaths on October 7 were caused by friendly fire, either on our website, on social media, or in public discussions of the event. If this statement by Dwoskin can not be sourced to anything we wrote or said, it must be publicly retracted.\n\nDwoskin falsely claims, \"the [Israeli] army has said it will investigate\" friendly fire deaths on October 7. To prove her point, she links to the following Associated Press article, which states, \"The military has said it will conduct a thorough investigation of everything that went wrong on Oct. 7 and the days that followed once\u00a0its war on Hamas is over.\"\n\nHowever, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu insists the war must continue until the end of 2024. Further, the AP article goes on to state, \"But that\u2019s not soon enough for some family members of 13 people killed [by Israeli friendly fire] during a violent standoff between Hamas and Israeli security forces at\u00a0Kibbutz Be\u2019eri, along the Gaza border.\"\n\nIn other words, the Israeli military has not announced any concrete plans to investigate friendly fire deaths. On the contrary, the families of Israeli victims of IDF friendly fire in Kibbutz Beeri on October 7 have been stonewalled, and they are furious about it.\n\nDwoskin's\u00a0claim is therefore false \u2013 debunked by the very article she linked to \u2013 and must be corrected.\n\nDwoskin's article relies heavily on \"research\" by the National Contagion Research Institute (NCRI) and its founder, Joel Finkelstein. She failed to mention that the NCRI is formally partnered with the Anti-Defamation League (see attachment), a pro-Israel lobbying organization that previously employed Finkelstein as a research fellow.\u00a0According to Joel Finkelstein's LinkedIn profile, he was simultaneously a research fellow with the ADL and running NCRI between December 2018 and October 2020. See here.\n\nWhy was the shadowy NCRI's organizational affiliation with a notoriously censorious pro-Israel pressure group not acknowledged to readers of the Washington Post? Are your readers not entitled to transparency about the ulterior sectarian agendas of the supposed experts cited by your reporters?\n\nIn a public phone conversation which Dwoskin solicited with me, I and my colleague, Aaron Mate, challenged Dwoskin's\u00a0claims about our \"minimizing\" of atrocities on October\u00a07. We also questioned her about her ideological dedication to Zionism and the state of Israel \u2013 an obvious conflict of interest which contravenes the Washington Post's proclaimed dedication to objectivity.\n\nWhen we asked her about an\u00a0editorial\u00a0she wrote for the Columbia Spectator in which she justified Zionist colonization of Palestine on the grounds that Palestinians were \"desert Bedouins without a sense of national identity as we know it today,\" Dwoskin hung up on us.",

This effort is aimed to raise funds in order to offer staff writing positions to three of our most dedicated contributors: Kit Klarenberg, Wyatt Reed and Alex Rubenstein. \n \nGoFundMe has stated that it should only take a few days for your donation to be transferred to the Grayzone accounts. Well, it's been over three weeks and not one cent has been transferred. Nothing!  \n \nWe have been in touch with GoFundMe a few times and it's clear that they are cowering to political pressure which they describe as \"external concerns\" and that it is \u201cfor our safety\u201d that they aren't transferring funds. Read more at the article just published at The Grayzone.  \n \nGoFundMe has not told you that the money you donated has been held by them in an act of financial sabotage.

In doing so, it created fertile ground for the Islamic State and brought foreign conflicts home to American soil.\n\nThese failed wars abroad have made the United States more vulnerable to both terrorism as well as native ultra-nationalism.

He referred to the entire city as \"a bomb factory,\" justifying the invasion because, in his words, \"virtually one hundred percent of the people there are supporting terrorism.\" According to RFK, \"everybody [in Jenin] is involved in bomb making\" \u2013 there are no civilians there at all, therefore all are legitimate targets. \n\nHe did not seem to know that the Palestinian campaign of suicide bombing ended well over 15 years ago, or that the Palestinian Authority is legally forbidden from defending Palestinians from Israeli violence \u2013 its primary function is to act as an occupation subcontractor. According to RFK Jr, the PA has an official \"pay-to-slay policy,\" in which \"if you kill any Jew, you are going to get awarded with pay for life.\" Even professional AIPAC lobbyists shy away from this kind of baseless invective.\n\nThe half-baked hasbara escalated from there as RFK Jr cited Richard Kemp, a former British army officer who subsists on Israel lobby speaking fees, to claim \"the conduct of the IDF, the Israeli defense forces when they go into Palestinian territories, is beyond anything in the world.\" \n\nWhile Israeli army commanders openly adhere to the Dahiya Doctrine, named for the Beirut neighborhood Israel leveled in 2006, and which calls for targeting Arab civilians in order to turn them against their leadership, RFK Jr insisted that Israel's policy is to \"avoid civilian casualties\" \u2013 it exclusively attacks military targets. \n\nIt is hard to believe RFK Jr's ahistorical, belligerent line on Israel-Palestine was not bought and paid for by some pro-Israel billionaire. Which means he's just as corruptible as any Democrat or GOP hack. But if he actually believes what he's saying, he's also at least as pro-war as they are.\n\nMax Blumenthal\n\nhttps://twitter.com/MaxBlumenthal/status/1684851741844525056",

        "message": "Neo-Nazi terror threat grows as Ukraine fighters jailed in France\n\nThe jailing of two heavily armed French neo-Nazis returning from Ukraine highlights a looming problem for NATO states sponsoring the proxy war, and their conspiracy of silence on the nature of the threat. Both were on the radar of French domestic spying agency DGSI, which held files on them for endangering state security. One was a veteran of Chasseurs Alpins (Alpine Hunters), France\u2019s elite mountain infantry force. The other is a notorious local far-right activist.\n\nIt is likely the pair were planning to bring the terror of Ukraine\u2019s battlefields back home with them. Last November, Italian police arrested five members of the local neo-Nazi group, Order of Hagal, which maintains operational ties to Azov Battalion. A sixth member, then-fighting alongside Azov in Ukraine, remained wanted.\n\nGiven the US almost undoubtedly intends to throw Ukraine under the bus in the near future, it raises the almost inevitable prospect of vast scores of fascist fighters fleeing the country to elsewhere in Europe, bringing with them battlefield experience, and in many cases elite Western military training. High-end weapons and ammunition will be available in abundance on the black market, due to the massive wellspring of arms shipments to Kiev over the course of the conflict.

        "message": "How Britain Secretly Warped MH17 News Coverage\n\nhttps://thegrayzone.com/2023/03/05/british-intelligence-firm-mh17-news/\n\nIn November of 2022, a final judgment arrived in the trial of alleged perpetrators of the attack on Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 (MH17). Russia and the Donbas separatists having long-been convicted in the court of international public opinion, courtesy of a concerted media campaign waged by the Ukrainian Security Service, and notorious Bellingcat, may explain why mainstream interest in the verdict was virtually non-existent.\n\nI can now reveal there was a hitherto undisclosed dimension to that campaign. Much of the initial news coverage of MH17, which did so much to cement the narrative of Moscow's culpability, was heavily influenced by a shadowy entity called Pilgrims Group, which is closely tied to British intelligence. \n\nStaffed and led by British Special Forces veterans, Pilgrims Group is a private security company offering elite security services to London\u2019s embassies, diplomats, spies, and business interests abroad, particularly in high-risk environments. It also trains foreign militaries and paramilitary groups, and provides protection to reporters and their employers. \n\nIt was in the latter context that Pilgrims Group shaped media coverage \u2013 and by extension, official investigations \u2013 of MH17. The company had maintained a presence in Kiev since the early days of the US-orchestrated Maidan \u201crevolution\u201d in late 2013, shepherding journalists to and from the scenes of major events in Ukraine. In the process, it maintained control over what the reporters under its watch saw and how they understood the situations they encountered.\n\nAs such, Pilgrims Group played a pivotal role in convicting Russia and the Donbas separatists for MH17\u2019s downing. The operation began while the plane\u2019s wreckage remained smoldering on the ground of rebel-controlled territory, and ultimately prevented the initiation of any genuinely independent investigations.",

Genocidal EU and US sanctions on Damascus initially meant countries keen to assist with the quake's dire impact on Syria were unwilling and/or unable to do so. While there's since been an easing of these restrictions due to intense international pressure, the move is temporary, and what can get through is modest.\n\nIn this context, it's relevant to consider a time when the West was only too eager to invest vast sums to flood Syria with humanitarian aid - in service of regime change. In August 2016, a remarkable and never before disclosed covert British intelligence operation began at a secret site in Jordan, run by the CIA and MI6. Violent armed groups funded and armed by London and Washington were trained to provide medical assistance to wounded opposition combatants, creating the false image of a professional fighting force capable of replacing the Syrian government.\n \nhttps://kitklarenberg.substack.com/p/leaked-files-expose-britains-ambulances",

The images generated controversy not only due to the attitude of the candidate, but also because the luxurious party was paid for by the US Pharmaceutical company Pfizer, interested in expanding its business in Colombia.\n\nThe images were revealed by the Colombian outlet Cambio which cited a confidential source that stated that the party had taken place on October 9, 2021, when Hern\u00e1ndez had not yet revealed, at least publicly, his intention to run for the presidency of Colombia. However, the media outlet drew attention to the fact that \u201clobbyists interested in doing business with Colombia\u201d participated in the event.\n\nAccording to the revelation by Cambio, the party was held on a yacht, valued at $4.5 million, and its rental for six hours is about $5,000. On the night of October 9, 2021, the boat made a tour of Biscayne Bay, in Miami, with Hern\u00e1ndez, several men\u2014including two of the candidate\u2019s sons\u2014and 11 young women in bikinis.\n\nRodolfo Hern\u00e1ndez, lauded in US mainstream media as an \u201canti-corruption\u201d crusader, was defeated by left-wing politician Gustavo Petro in his bid for the presidency on June 19, 2022.\n\n\u27a8 thegrayzone.com/2022/06/19/pfizer-miami-yacht-colombia-presidential-rodolfo-hernandez\n\nFollow The Grayzone: \n\ud83d\udc49@TheGrayzoneNews",

The decision has triggered a new round of US-led sanctions while bringing attention to rebel-held areas, where,  according to UN figures on the Donbas war, 80% of civilian casualties have occurred since 2018.\n\nProfessor Richard Sakwa analyzes the factors behind Putin's move, and its likely consequences. Putin's decision, he says, comes after Kiev refused to implement the 2015 Minsk accords, which could have ended the conflict, and a longstanding US-driven project to expand NATO to Russia's borders. \n\nGuest: Richard Sakwa.

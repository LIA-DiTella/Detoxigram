While discussing tactics to thwart the future use of heavy equipment against such camps, a strategic mastermind weighed in with a \u201cbest case scenario\u201d. His advice was to take the bulldozer keys and eat them. \n\nIt should come as no surprise that someone whose screen name is @fisting_top has no qualms about passing bulldozer keys through his rectum. \n\nWe bring you these stories to show you who the enemy actually is. College age kids whose hobby is protesting, social outcasts with bad hygiene, blue hair and bizarre sexual fetishes or middle aged single self-loathing white women. They aren\u2019t fighting stock. The best they can manage is to build camps and live in squalor, get in your face and get loud or eat bulldozer keys. Stop tolerating them. These people are clowns. Opposing them is easy, just show up and stand there. Your presence alone is triggering enough. They are nothing to be feared.",

There is a segment of the population that he is describing that the govt absolutely wants gone. It\u2019s not completely white, but it is overwhelmingly so. Once they are gone, it\u2019s slavery for the rest of you. This group used to be made up of most of your firemen, policeman, and military. That was a problem for the government. Now they are replacing them with foreigners and leftists. They found the solution. \n\nAt the same time, too many whites are becoming rightfully pissed off and marginalizing ourselves from society. If we concede that middle ground, and a conflict kicks off with us easily painted as hateful terrorists, the institutions will bury us. I firmly believe, however, that if we contrast ourselves against the obvious evil of the left, and welcome all who want to help, we can maintain enough support from within the rank  and file of the institutions to overcome and win.

Two parties engaged in a business deal with each side verifying and agreeing to estimated values of loan collateral then entered into a contract legally and with due diligence. All debts were repaid. Since both parties estimated valuations both would be at fault if there was fraud yet only the borrower was prosecuted, not the bank.

They are devastating at short range, but quickly lose lethality as the distance increases. Firing a pattern of projectiles means shotguns are not capable of precise shot placement, to the point that beyond a few yards targeting an individual out of a crowd is impossible. This makes shotguns the single worst weapon to bring to a crowded event\u2026unless your intent is to kill indiscriminately. In that case, they\u2019re the perfect weapon.\n\nSo once again we\u2019re left playing the old antifa game of \u201cis he a dangerous moron with a gun he knows nothing about, or is he a violent psychopath that knows what he\u2019s doing??\u201d We may never know\u2026\n\nKIDDING!!\nOf course we know \ud83d\ude02\nThis retard also has no spare magazines and a mix of paintball and flea market kit.

The FBI has had a culture of abuses of power since J. Edgar Hoover. It has only gotten worse. Our nation existed for 132 years without the FBI. We can do it again. The majority of their criminal investigatory responsibilities can be delegated to state agencies. Unique nationwide responsibilities such as counter intelligence or cyber security can be transferred to the Secret Service or the US Marshals. We don\u2019t need or want a federal secret police force that reports directly to the administration in power and when called before congress for accountability refuses to answer questions. The FBI are enemies of the American people, it\u2019s time for them to go.",

Assuming he\u2019s allowed on the ballot, it is extremely unlikely that Donald Trump will win Colorado\u2019s 10 electoral votes, but this pales in significance when one considers that Donald Trump has not been convicted of any crime, let alone Insurrection, which is the false pretense being used to remove him from the ballot. \n\nThe Democrats have repeatedly shown that they will stop at nothing \nin their thirst for power. Election meddling, threats, intimidation, imprisoning political rivals\u2026all in a day\u2019s work. Nothing says \"protecting democracy\" quite like legally prohibiting one half of your state's citizens from voting for their candidate of choice in a Presidential election.\n\nThere\u2019s been a lot of crazy discussions over the last several years about political violence and civil war; what would it take, when is it justified, how do you know when it\u2019s time, etc. Very serious questions, but also largely academic and hypothetical, so they\u2019re very difficult to answer. The Proud Boys have always been very clear that the only type of government takeover we support is at the ballot box. However, there\u2019s a distinct possibility that Colorado is only the first state to adopt this tactic. What happens when Democrats take that ballot box option away from millions, or even tens of millions, of people?? When the peaceful option is gone, what does that leave?\n\nTo be crystal clear, the Proud Boys is a drinking club, not a militia. We\u2019re not making threats, but we\u2019re damn well putting everyone on notice: keep this kind of banana republic bullshit up and someone, somewhere, is going to start finding answers to those difficult questions.\n\nDon\u2019t say we didn\u2019t warn you.",

        "message": "Hard truths about a hard war. \nPart Two\n\nModern day Israel was the land promised to Abraham in the book of Genesis. It was called Canaan before it became the promised land. You may not believe the biblical record but archeological and historical records confirm this. The name Palestine was used hundreds of years later after Judea was conquered by the Roman Empire. Anyone who narrates the history of this conflict beginning with Palestine is ignoring hundreds of years of history. \n\nModern day Israel and Palestine were founded together after the Second World War. Once established, multiple Arab nations attacked Israel. These Arab nations lost. As a result, Palestinians lost territory. This is what happens when you initiate then lose a war. The land won in this and other successive wars belongs to Israel. \n\nOnce post-war borders were established, Israel began a consistent history of expanding out from the established borders and creating settlements on Palestinian land. They were not welcome there and understandably so. If people from a bordering nation came to our country illegally and claimed a right to stay here we would have serious issues with that. Oh\u2026 wait a minute. They already do. We don\u2019t like it either. \n\nThe holocaust ended 78 years ago. The world doesn\u2019t owe Israel generations of unquestioned support because they feel bad about the holocaust. The same can be said about slavery. \n\nPaying Ukrainians to kill Russians doesn\u2019t make us safer. Paying Israelis to kill Islamic fundamentalists is a slightly better investment. The best investment would be to spend tax dollars on securing our own border and conducting massive deportations of anyone in this country illegally. As we have learned from Hamas, they are willing to pretend to be peaceful for as long as it takes to prepare another attack. These same people have undoubtedly infiltrated our border. Finding them must be our immediate priority. \n\nThere can be no peace with Islamic fundamentalists. Ever. They only understand violence. They must be killed. This is the only way.",

        "message": "Hard truths about a hard war. \nPart One\n\nMany have said that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict isn\u2019t complicated. It is.  Multiple matters can be factual at once. Somewhere between the \u201cIsrael can do no wrong\u201d crowd and the \u201cHamas are freedom fighters\u201d crowd you can find the truth. The truth is ugly, but it\u2019s the truth none the less. \n\nIsraeli civilians were attacked in a barbaric and savage manner. If this happened in our town we would absolutely want anyone responsible to be killed. We would strive to kill them ourselves. We would attempt to save civilians but not at the expense of the total annihilation of the enemies who did this. A brutal response from Israel is completely justified. There is a word for ruthless retaliation. That word is war. \n\nHamas is a terrorist organization. Those who support Hamas are supporting terrorism.\n\nIslamic fundamentalism is a scourge on this earth. It always has been. The sooner it is eradicated the better off humanity will be. \n\nCriticizing Israel does not make you anti-semitic. \n\nIn day to day life, Israel treats Palestinians with an iron fist. Israel is a borderline apartheid state. Palestinians are second class citizens and are routinely met with force. Sometimes unjustifiably so. People can only take but so much. Unfortunately Palestinians subscribe to the traditional Arab way of warfare which involves rapes and beheadings. When they finally snap, they go big. \n\nPalestinians with a history of terrorism and absolute hatred of Jews live next door to Israel. They need to be dealt with using an iron fist. Their own behavior necessitates this. If you had a multitude of dogs living next door and many of them were known to be rabid, you treat them all like rabid dogs. If you don\u2019t you\u2019ll eventually be bitten. This outlook is completely rational. Innocent Palestinians are undoubtedly harmed by this. \n\nIsrael is not our \u201cgreatest ally\u201d. They are our best friend in the region. That\u2019s not saying much considering their neighbors are Gaza, Lebanon and Syria. Honest questions: What does Israel do for America? Is there any other nation on earth that has contributed so little to America yet received so much from us in return? Let\u2019s take a minute to discuss what a \u201cgreat ally\u201d actually is. France during the American revolution was a great ally. We would not have won our independence if they didn\u2019t come to our aid. The British empire during the Second World War was a great ally. Utah and Omaha beaches were American successes but Gold, Juno and Sword beaches were taken by the British sealing the victory at Normandy. These were great allies. When has Israel ever done anything even remotely close to this for us? Israel is a taker. They hardly ever give to anyone or anything that doesn\u2019t directly benefit Jews either domestically or internationally. For example, in the days leading up to the Russian-Ukrainian war the Israeli government formed a group to oversee the evacuation of Jewish Ukrainian citizens. Not Israeli citizen/passport holders living in Ukraine, but full fledged Ukrainian citizens who were also Jewish. Notice how your initial reaction to reading this is \u201cso what?\u201d. Now imagine you are a Ukrainian refugee fleeing with your children from Russian forces advancing in the Donbas. You make it to the airport and the only flight out is an Israeli one. They tell you \u201cwe\u2019re sorry, but you\u2019re not Jewish\u201d. You and your family are denied safe passage based on race. You beg them to take your children. They say \u201cNo, they aren\u2019t Jewish either\u201d. Israel could have planned to be part of an international coalition to evacuate all non-combatants willing to leave regardless of race, then after reaching a safe destination determine who would be eligible for Israeli citizenship. They chose not to. Government sponsored racism is unacceptable, no matter which government chooses to partake in it.",

Children should never, ever, be the targets of violence. In the interest of our anti-PC tenet we are compelled to remind everyone of another child murder, one most of you almost certainly missed. Consider the coverage disparity between the recent murder of Wadea Al-Fayoume and the murder of 5 y/o Cannon Hinnant, there\u2019s no comparison. Cannon\u2019s murder was barely mentioned, and when it was there was no motive attributed to the act.

Jamaal\u2019s actions are clearly an obstruction of an official proceeding and conspiracy to prevent members of congress from discharging their duties.

Neither side are Proud Boys. We\u2019re here to tell you what actually happened. \n\nTo understand the Proud Boys at January 6th, you have to understand the DC rallies that happened in late 2020. While strategically they were a success in regards to showing a strong presence and deterring Antifa violence, tactically there was room for improvement. Proud Boys were spread thin across multiple city blocks with no centralized plan regarding safety or accountability of personnel. We never had that many chapters in one place before and needed more organization. From March for Life to Rolling Thunder, every large group legally marching in Washington DC faces these challenges and our organization was no different. Enrique Tarrio, our chairman at the time, formed a planning commission known as \u201cMinistry Of Self Defense\u201d (MOSD) for this sole purpose. It was this planning structure that the federal government used in an attempt to show a conspiracy. It was also during this planning process where our former chairman explicitly instructed all members to not cross police lines. A recording of an MOSD planning meeting containing this directive was made public during the trial. The DOJ attempted to conceal it but despite their best efforts the recording was released by the Gateway Pundit. You may view the recording here: https://www.thegatewaypundit.com/2022/06/exclusive-proud-boys-proven-innocent-newly-released-video-hidden-public-biden-doj-tried-hide-leaked-evidence-blows-doj-liz-cheneys-bogus-seditious-conspiracy-charges/\n\nOn the day of January 6th there was no plan to storm the Capitol. Our former chairman wasn\u2019t even in the city. Proud Boys were there to hear the President of the United States speak, to show solidarity with those who believed as we do that the election was stolen and to act as a deterrent against Antifa. Our January 6th involvement was planned to end at a barbecue across the Virginia state line, not in the house chamber. Any citizen who entered the Capitol did so on their own accord and not as a foot soldier in a seditious conspiracy or at the behest of any organization, including our own. This trial was politically motivated and brought forth to set a precedent for future convictions and to make an example of our members by egregiously over charging and over sentencing them. Now, any group that stands against the current regime and schedules a protest then plans in advance for their own safety, logistics and member conduct is in danger of a seditious conspiracy charge.",

        "message": "Queer theory has always been about eliminating age of consent, both as laws and as a concept. \n\nOften cited as the godfather of queer theory, Michael Foucault fought to abolish age of consent laws in France until the day he died of AIDS.\n\nThe foundational document of queer theory was written by Gayle Rubin. Roughly half of that 1984 essay, \"Thinking Sex,\" is aimed at defending \"boylovers.\"  Wikipedia white washes her essay specifically and her ideas generally to say the least. To avoid ambiguity, here's a quote pulled directly from that queer theory foundational work:\n\"Like communists and homosexuals in the 1950s, boylovers are so stigmatized that it is difficult to find defenders for their civil liberties, let alone for their erotic orientation.\"\n\nPat Califia-Rice is another foundational figure of queer theory. Pat is a trans man that formerly identified as a lesbian woman and has written extensively about bdsm subculture as well as penning lesbian erotica, including works involving incest and pedophilic encounters which also delve into bdsm territory. Here's an (extremely tame but telling) excerpt:\n\"Any child old enough to decide whether or not she or he wants to eat spinach, play with trucks, or wear shoes is old enough to decide whether or not she or he wants to run around naked in the sun, masturbate, sit in someone's lap, or engage in sexual activity.\"\nShe has also stated that she believes pedophiles should be more, not less, involved in children's lives.\n\nJudith Butler is today's most well known queer theorist. She has argued at length that occasions of parent-child incest are not necessarily abusive, and to entirely oppose such interactions is abusive to those children. She advocates to remove incest laws as they are a violation of those consensual sexual encounters between adults and minors. Here's a quote:\n\"So I keep adding this qualification, 'when incest is a violation,' suggesting that I think that there may be occasions in which it is not. Why would I talk that way? Well, I do think that there are probably forms of incest that are not necessarily traumatic, or which gain their traumatic character by virtue of the consciousness of social shame that they produce.\"\n\nPerhaps not all proponents of queer theory are pedophiles. That said, queer theory itself does, as a matter of fact, promote pedophilia.",

He resigned on Sept. 3, 2021, more than a year before being indicted by a Knox County grand jury on charges related to the case.\nBobo\u2019s wife, Elisabeth Bobo, was also indicted in the case and pleaded guilty on April 18 to one count of misuse of credit cards, a fourth-degree felony, and one count of telecommunication fraud, a fifth-degree felony.\nBoth Daniel and Elisabeth Bobo will be sentenced on June 22 and are expected to pay restitution upon sentencing.\n\nThe Bobos befriended Kay and Richard Hoppe and helped the elderly couple move into a Mount Vernon nursing home. After Richard Hoppe died in 2018, the Bobos used a power of attorney granted by the Hoppes to Danial Bobo to access credit cards in the Hoppe\u2019s name and bank accounts that contained the Hoppe\u2019s assets.\nThe Bobos used more than $500,000 for their own personal expenses. Suffering from dementia attributed to Alzheimer\u2019s disease, Kay Hoppe passed away in 2020 at the age of 78 and Danial Bobo was named the executor of the estate.\nThe attorney general\u2019s Bureau of Criminal Investigation (BCI) investigated the case, and the Special Prosecutions Section of Yost\u2019s office is prosecuting the case.",

Be the hero of your own life story. An able protector. A warrior. Instead of watching formidable men play sports and obsessing over it go to the gym. Skip the bar Friday night and buy some boxing gloves with your buddies. Get punched in the face. Realize that you aren't fragile. Carrying a warm mildly-sore black eye around feels good. It makes you feel alive. It may just be the first time you ever really felt like a man in your life. \n\nTry it. Learn the difference between pain and injury. Realize that they both heal quicker than fear or shame. Make yourself formidable. Stand up to anyone and everything that you think is wrong. You might get hurt. You might get arrested. You might even die in the process. \n\nAlternatively, you might also live to be 90. You might literally rot to death before your own eyes. A helpless burden on everyone you have ever loved. Having successfully lived a long and safe life that didn't mean shit. No one talked about you. No one felt the way about you... that you feel about those action heroes you read about or watched on TV. Your sons never envied your feats. They envied the feats of imaginary heroes and villains on TV while they sat beside you on the couch. \n\nYou might just live vicariously, for 90 years, through anyone and everyone that society tells you to. While leaving behind a third-world fucking dump for your posterity. You might do that also. Is that what you are being careful for? Is that why you follow all of the rules? If not, try waking up tomorrow and realizing that you are an animal. Albeit a smart animal. A civilized animal. Still an animal. Your soul craves excitement, dominance, contest, love, lust, hate, and the assurance of the survival of your bloodline. All things that you believe are reserved for others. Things you have been told are primitive and evil. They are not. They are the only reason you are here. Deny them and you will stay miserable. You will look up to people that don't exist. You will live long, die empty, and regret it all from the afterlife. \n\nBe a man",

The Proud Boys, having brought over 2000 members to the prior November and December rallies...brought a total of 60 men to take over the government of the United States of America.\n\n3. Those same Proud Boys, well known for their love of firearms and their open advocacy of arming ALL Americans...brought no guns to their insurrection against the government of the United States.\n\n4.Those same Proud Boys, upon gaining access to the interior of the United States Capitol, used said access to commit illegal acts like...using a restroom and smoking a cigarette (*gasp*), immediately followed by leaving the premises and going to a bar.\n\n5. The United States government, having as many as a dozen (known so far, almost certainly more) infiltrators and informants seeded into various Proud Boy groups, both in DC and elsewhere, and Proud Boy chats, to include the J6 event planning chat...got no indication or information from the inside that the Proud Boys had planned an insurrection. \n\n6. One of the said informants told his FBI handler that the Proud Boys inside the United States Capitol actively engaged in criminal activities, specifically...that they were keeping the normies calm around them to prevent violence and encouraging them to peacefully leave.\n\n7. The Proud Boys, seasoned and experienced \"domestic terrorists\", chose Dominic Pezzola, having joined his chapter the previous December, a veteran of less than 3 weeks that didn't even know where the bathrooms were in the clubhouse yet...to lead the assault on the Capitol of the United states of America.\n\nWe could go on, but do we really need to?

We don\u2019t care what you look like or who you sleep with, and as Western Chauvinists we put the ideas of maximum freedom and minimum government on a very tall pedestal. This means that whatever our individual personal feeling may be, as a fraternity we don\u2019t have a problem with drag queens performing for adults. But let's be clear, we draw a solid line at sexualizing children. \nThis event has been passed off as just some guy dressed in funny clothes reading to kids\u2026but as we already know that\u2019s rarely how these events actually turn out. Raucous and bawdy dance numbers involving men in scanty or sexually suggestive clothing are the norm, with a disturbingly high chance of male genitals somehow falling out in full view of children. How exactly does one forget to put on panties when wearing a skirt to a children\u2019s event\u2026and why is it so important for children to be involved in these events anyway?\nWe have to ask ourselves, what kind of man feels that dressing up in blackface-for-women and performing a sexually suggestive striptease for kids is not only appropriate, but important?? Now, clearly not all of these performers are pedophiles, but numerous news articles will show that an unusually high number of them indeed are. \nBottom line, this is grooming and this is child abuse. So enjoy your adult entertainment with adults, even drag shows, we hope you have fun, but if you call it \u201cfamily friendly\u201d or \u201call ages\u201d you\u2019ll be seeing us... and\nWe. Are.

That\u2019s all. Trump used the gesture often in his speeches, a 4chan troller launched a hoax saying it meant \u201cwhite power\u201d and the wokesters believed it.

Since triggering blue-hairs into emotional meltdown is a favorite pastime of Proud Boys it became our unofficial hand gesture. It\u2019s hilarious.

Many Proud Boys cut Fred Perry completely out of the picture, taking their money elsewhere and acquiring knock-off shirts then affixing a laurel. To obtain an original shirt a Proud Boy can look to his brothers overseas. This shirt was sent from Australia and cost the same after shipping as one of a different color still available from the Fred Perry US online store. \n\nWhat does this mean? It means it was obtained at a cheaper price, sold at a market price, and the profit went not to Fred Perry but directly into the pocket of a Proud Boy.

If anyone questions their critical importance to the founding of this great nation, they only need to imagine the consequences of men such as Mitch McConnel, Adam Schiff, Adam Kinzinger, or Joe Biden in that position. A blank slate lay before them; a potential hoard of unfathomable resources and value ripe for the taking. If the current crop of political \"leaders\" were in charge then, the \"United States of America\" would never have been more than a long forgotten name on the long list of failed nations. The constraint and strength of character displayed by those great men is hard to even envision today. We owe them so much.

American Indians enslaved white settlers and members of neighboring tribes keeping slavery alive throughout the western United States for many years after Juneteenth. \n\nWestern Civilization was one of many civilizations that practiced slavery. We were also the first to end it.",

        "message": "Sometime back our brother Andy Walls was the victim of a hate crime, soon followed by a lynching in the court of public opinion. For those that are unaware, Andy is gay. That night Andy and his husband were targeted in a series of homophobic attacks, both verbal and physical. Here is extended video (https://bit.ly/3xY8xLv) of the incident, where everyone can see the truth for themselves. We look forward to Andy's acquittal, and once again we'll remind everyone: OUR GAYS ARE BETTER THAN THEIR GAYS. UHURU!\n\n\nVideo talking points:\n\n1. First punch is thrown by \"Boomer in Black Hoodie\" at about :43 (Still shot: Andy1.png, better shot of the asshole himself BoomerBlackHoodie.jpg). We don't have an ID on this asshole that I know of. \n  \n2. You can see the alleged victim, Cameron Morgan is already on scene and part of the mob taunting Andy and his husband at about :52 when you can see her shadow, then her at the lower right. She's hanging with \"Creep in Gray Hoodie\" who still has his red knit cap on (he loses it a few times). CreepGrayHoodie.jpg is a fair shot of his face, without the red knit cap.  He's not ID'd yet either that I know of.  He takes shots at Andy, then multiple shots at \"OtherMan1, Tan Pants, Black Cap\" while that poor bastard is down and helpless. \n\n3. Andy gets knocked down and gets back up at about 1 minute in. Alleged victim Note Cameron Morgan, her alleged co-victim \"Short Broad Black Ball Cap\" continue to taunt him with anti-gay slurs and he approaches them...STOPPING AND TAKING A DEFENSIVE POSTURE at 1:06 as he warns her \"Nigger bitch shut your mouth\".  He is standing his ground, not advancing. \n\n4. At 1:07 you can see both Cameron Morgan and \"Short Broad Black Ball Cap\" ADVANCING TOWARDS Andy in a threatening manner and running their mouths. At 1:08 you can see Cameron Morgan grabbing Andy's left arm and \"Short Broad Black Ball Cap\" kicking him in the balls as Andy cocks his right arm to defend himself by punching the advancing Cameron Morgan. Pretty clear that they touched him first and were NOT just innocent bystanders.  (Still shot: Andy2.png) \n\n5. Cameron Morgan claims that she left the scene after she got hit, too distraught to hang around for the cops.  The video shows that she not only hung around, but pulled away from people trying to hold her back so that she could take shots at Andy while he was on the ground and also \"OtherMan1, Tan Pants, Black Cap\" long after Andy had left the scene.  Her friend \"Short Broad Black Ball Cap\" also stuck around and got shots in to both men.  What the video doesn't show, but they have evidence proving, is that these distraught women didn't go home, as they claim, they went to another bar!  Worse, the notion that she had a concussion and blacked out is utter bullshit...they didn't claim that crap until AFTER a Akron Detective told them both would help get the charges escalated to felonies, when she interviewed Morgan and her mother a day later. \n\n6. As you can see in the video, Andy was gone by 1:32 or so, but the mob, including Morgan, \"Short Broad Black Ball Cap\", \"Creep in Gray Hoodie\", \"Boomer in Black Hoodie\" and the \"Fat Bitch in Peach Jacket\" continue to stomp and assault \"OtherMan1, Tan Pants, Black Cap\", until he finally gets back to his feet at 2:41, only to be pushed back out into the street for another beating at 2:52 by the owner of the bar (Barmacy), Walid Loutfi.   \n\nBottom line the only \"hate crime\" or assaults here were not perpetrated by Andy, his husband or \"OtherMan1, Tan Pants, Black Cap\".  They were the victims and the rest of this bunch need to be ID'd so charges can be pressed and lawsuits filed.  \n\nAndy's lawyers released the longer, unedited video to the Akron Beacon Journal 2 weeks ago, but they didn't publish a story until today and even then declined to release the video. Here is the story they published today: https://bit.ly/3ESQoA6\n\nOriginal video, edited by the victims and the media to only show the preferred narrative.

This sham trial is based purely on speculation that evidence exists somewhere that the FBI simply hasn't found yet. The prosecution is dangling little quotes they found in our chats to tease everyone into thinking they have some big reveal coming. They want everyone to think they have a smoking gun and five aces up their sleeve. They don't. They have their dick in their hand. All the evidence they have is in the indictment. They have our plans to legally attend a protest, some shit we talked about it afterwards, and nothing in between. Point blank, it's a nothing burger. They're saying it's a conspiracy because that's what they want to believe. Our brothers are in prison because a bunch of rich assholes got pissed off and now they want someone to pay for it. This charade has gone on long enough. The prosecutions whole case is omitting 99% of what they found in our chats so they can show a handful of quotes with the context removed. When this case finally goes to trial after God knows how long, everyone is going to see the facts of this case for what they are and it's all going to fall apart. So rather than wait till the 12th of never to find out, here are the facts of this case:\n\n1. There was no plan whatsoever to storm the capitol.\n2. There was barely even a plan to attend the legal protest that day, as we have done dozens of times before.\n3. The prosecution is claiming all plans made that day, regardless of what they were, were plans to storm the capitol.\n4. The MOSD was created to stop everyone from running around aimlessly and having our brothers injured at rallies. Nothing more.\n5. The prosecution has entire pages and an entire video conference that outline exactly what the mosd was created for. \n6. The prosecution is hiding all of that documentation so they can lie about why the MOSD was created and what it was to be used for.\n7. Whatever document that some random guy allegedly sent to Enrique, was never mentioned, shared, or discussed once among anyone else but him and whoever that was. The prosecution does not even allege that Enrique agreed to whatever thing that was. \n8. These J6 cases are a mess. The overwhelming majority of people that day simply followed the crowd, walked into the capital, and walked back out. But in dozens of instances the prosecution is calling that either misdemeanor parading or felony obstruction, based on nothing but a whim with no consistent application of the law whatsoever. \n\nWhatever the outcome of this trial, this will forever be remembered as a shameful stain on the DOJ, the FBI, and our country as a whole. This is the administration that let pedophiles, rapists, and arsonists off the hook then threw the book at purple heart veterans and eagle scouts.",

Leadership stops at the chapter level. Chapters may work together, they may fight with each other. As with any family sometimes brothers fight but God help the outsider who attacks your brother.

These numbers are determinative and, in all cases, are hundreds of thousands of Votes per Swing State more than I needed to WIN that State. If the Republican Senate does not step forward and address this ATROCITY, it will happen again, and be virtually impossible for Republicans to WIN ELECTIONS in the future. \n\nRemember, I was not campaigning\u2014The 2020 Election was LONG OVER. What I was doing is bringing to light the fact that the Election was, without question, Rigged and Stolen. As President, and Commander-in-Chief, it was my duty to do so! If I did not do this, I would have been in violation of my Oath of Office, and the Take Care Clause, which requires the President to \u201ctake Care that the Laws be faithfully executed.\u201d Therefore I am entitled to Total Immunity, because that is exactly what I was doing, Taking Care of our Country, and Guarding it from Rigged and Stolen Elections. Democrats are willing to play a far different game. They are willing to Cheat at levels never seen before.\n\nPlease study these numbers carefully, analyze what\u2019s been done, keep an open mind, and be smart\u2014Because the Democrats are already trying to do it again, but adding one more weapon, Prosecutorial Misconduct\u2014Using the DOJ, FBI, and local Attorney Generals and D.A.\u2019s to go after Crooked Joe Biden\u2019s Political Opponent\u2014ME.

Nothing like this has ever happened to a President of the United States before. After working and cooperating with the relevant Government agencies, this unannounced raid on my home was not necessary or appropriate. It is prosecutorial misconduct, the weaponization of the Justice System, and an attack by Radical Left Democrats who desperately don't want me to run for President in 2024, especially based on recent polls, and who will likewise do anything to stop Republicans and Conservatives in the upcoming Midterm Elections. Such an assault could only take place in broken, Third-World Countries. Sadly, America has now become one of those Countries, corrupt at a level not seen before. They even broke into my safe! What is the difference between this and Watergate, where operatives broke into the Democrat National Committee? Here, in reverse, Democrats broke into the home of the 45th President of the United States.\n\nThe political persecution of President Donald J. Trump has been going on for years, with the now fully debunked Russia, Russia, Russia Scam, Impeachment Hoax #1, Impeachment Hoax #2, and so much more, it just never ends. It is political targeting at the highest level!\n\nHillary Clinton was allowed to delete and acid wash 33,000 E-mails AFTER they were subpoenaed by Congress. Absolutely nothing has happened to hold her accountable. She even took antique furniture, and other items from the White House.\n\nI stood up to America's bureaucratic corruption, I restored power to the people, and truly delivered for our Country, like we have never seen before. The establishment hated it. Now, as they watch my endorsed candidates win big victories, and see my dominance in all polls, they are trying to stop me, and the Republican Party, once more. The lawlessness, political persecution, and Witch Hunt must be exposed and stopped.\n\nI will continue to fight for the Great American People!",

Trump, who also just happens to be the 45th President of the United States, and is leading in every poll to be the 47th. The Fake News also didn't reveal the fact that this is virtually unprecedented for private lawyers to take an unpaid leave of absence from an opposing party law firm in order to prosecute anyone, let alone a former President. They also didn't tell you that a principal leader of the firm is Robert Schumer, the brother of Chuck Schumer, that the firm is a Never Trumper firm and works for the Democrat Party, that for lawyers to go into the New York City's District Attorney's office to prosecute an opponent is unprecedented in NYC history because the District Attorney's office has hundreds of lawyers already working there, and that a number of Assistant District Attorneys refused to work on the case because they felt I was being treated extremely unfairly, and that indeed, there was no case.\n\nCan you imagine a Never Trumper Democrat-only law firm sending a Never Trumper law partner with two associates to the District Attorney's office to prosecute their political opponent, Donald J. Trump, and the firm represents the Democrat Party, and is headed by Robert Schumer, Chuck Schumer's brother, and many other Never Trumpers? What kind of Country are we living in?",

That\u2019s why the Democrats and RINOs are working feverishly together to change the very law that Mike Pence and his unwitting advisors used on January 6 to say he had no choice. The reason they want it changed is because they now say they don\u2019t want the Vice President to have the right to ensure an honest vote. In other words, I was right and everyone knows it.

Does anybody really think that Biden beat Obama with the Black population in select Swing State cities, but nowhere else? That he would lose 18 out of 19 bellwether counties, and 27 out of 27 \u201ctoss up\u201d House races, but somehow miraculously receive the most votes in American history with no coattails? That he would lose Florida, Ohio, and Iowa and win, even though it has never been done before?\n\nThey spread a \u201cweb of lies\u201d about me and Russia for 4 years to try to overturn the 2016 election, and now they lie about how they interfered in the 2020 Election, too. Big Tech was used illegally.\n\nWhere did all those votes show up from in Georgia, where it was just revealed they sold ballots for $10 a piece, or in Pennsylvania, and Arizona, and Wisconsin. He acts like he's aggrieved, but we're the ones who were aggrieved and America is suffering because of it with poisonous Borders, record Inflation, a humiliating surrender in Afghanistan, $5 a gallon gas and higher, empty stock shelves, and rampant crime.\u00a0America is a laughingstock stock of the world, and it's all because of the real insurrection, which took place on November 3rd, but this is an election year and MAGA Republicans should get elected and work with me to fix this horror that Joe Biden and the Democrats have brought us.\n\nNever forget the crime of the 2020 Presidential Election.

I have since found out that McCain, who was close to last in his class at Annapolis, sent the fake and totally discredited scam Dossier to the FBI, hoping to stop the \u201cTrump Train.\u201d In any event, Meghan should fight the Communists instead of explaining how they beat her, hurt her, and made her \u201cphysically ill.\u201d She should fight back against the Losers of The View the way she fights against very good and well-meaning Republicans, and she would do herself a world of good!",

Much of it is already public, and a great deal more is coming out in the very near future. Every time you read a statement that there is \u201cno evidence of election fraud,\u201d about the 2020 election scam, just attribute that statement to a crooked and collusive media (they work closely together with the Radical Left Democrats) that will do anything to hide the real facts of this election fiasco.  \n \nAfter seeing the irrefutable evidence from numerous states, others are talking about doing deep forensic audits. This election was a scam, and the Lamestream Media is doing everything in their power not to allow the people to see or read about what really took place. We no longer have a free and open media (they don\u2019t cover the truth), but the word is getting out stronger than ever before. \n \nEven the Justice Department has no interest in the crooked and corrupt 2020 Presidential Election. They are only interested in hurting those who want to reveal how totally dishonest it was. The Justice Department should be looking at the people who rigged the election, not the Patriots of our Country who are seeking to find how our Nation was defrauded.\n \nWe must also look to the future and fight for State Legislatures to reform their elections so that this will NEVER happen again. In the end, truth will WIN! \n \nContribute to Save America and DonaldJTrump.com in order to keep continuing this fight.",

Trump, 45th President of the United States of America\n\nVery interesting, funny, yet sad, that every time I read or hear a story in the Lamestream Media about the 2020 Presidential Election Scam, it always is preceded by the fact that, \u201cwhile no evidence of voter fraud is available,\u201d or statements to that effect, this could not be more incorrect or \u201cfake.\u201d Massive evidence has been accumulated which shows voter fraud at a level that is virtually beyond comprehension. The Radical left writers say this nonsense over and over again, and so does the Fake News Media. What is true, is that as evidence comes out, they don\u2019t write about it or bring it forward in any way, shape, or form. Nevertheless, and fortunately, it gets out through the internet and other methods, and the feeling of a Fake Election is stronger now than ever before. Check out the recent story of 35,000 votes in the great State of Georgia, and watch what is happening in Arizona, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and other States. The only reason Detroit, Michigan, is not yet under investigation is because the Republicans in the State Senate are a bunch of weak RINOs that are afraid to act. Detroit is one of the most corrupt places on Earth, and the information is coming out, and fast. In any event, Mainstream Media should stop saying that, \u201cwhile all the allegations are false,\u201d when they know the exact opposite is true. People and facts are coming out at a level which can only be called \u201cfast and furious.\u201d",

After hundreds of subpoenas, over 3 million pages of documents, 4 years of searching, dozens and dozens of interviews, and millions of dollars of taxpayer funds wasted, they continue to be \u201cin search of a crime\u201d and will do anything to frighten people into making up the stories or lies that they want, but have been totally unable to get. In an unprecedented move, they retained an outside \u201cNever Trumper\u201d lawyer from a Trump-hating law firm to work on the case. It is a continuation of the greatest Witch Hunt of all time.\n \nNow they are issuing ultimatums, working in close conjunction with the Washington, D.C. hacks who have been investigating me from the day I came down the escalator in Trump Tower, but who have failed. In fact, the guilty parties were these prosecutors\u2019 partners in crime, the Radical Left Democrats and friends. They will do anything to stop the MAGA movement (and me), even if it involves prosecutorial misconduct and harassment of a political opponent, which they are using at levels rarely seen before. They leak, they lie, and they campaign based on information that has already been gone through in other of the many investigations I have put up with. \n \nNow they just leaked that we were given one day, today, to make our case about things that are standard practice throughout the U.S. business community, and in no way a crime. They also know that no matter how strong our case, they will work hard to embarrass us and the Republican Party. \n \nHaving politically motivated prosecutors, people who actually got elected because they will \u201cget Donald Trump,\u201d is a very dangerous thing for our Country. In the end, people will not stand for it. Remember, if they can do this to me, they can do it to anyone! Why would anyone bring their company to New York, or even stay in New York, knowing these Radical Left Democrats would willingly target their company if viewed as a political opponent? It is devastating for New York!\n \nThese Witch Hunters are relentlessly seeking to destroy a reputation of a President who has done a great job for this Country, including tax and regulation cuts, Border control, rebuilding the Military, and developing the vaccine in record time\u2014thereby saving our Country, and far beyond. Washington, D.C. and ultimately, the U.S. Supreme Court, should finally stop these vicious, angry, and highly partisan prosecutors. They are a disgrace to our Nation!",

If we don\u2019t address these issues from the 2020 Election head on, and we allow the Radical Left Democrats to continue to politicize the DOJ and Law Enforcement, we will lose our Country.

For instance, I closed our Borders to China very early despite his not wanting them closed. The Democrats and the Fake News Media even called me a \u201cxenophobe.\u201d In the end, we saw this was a life-saving decision, and likewise with closing our borders to Europe, specifically to certain heavily infected countries. I was later given credit, even by \u201cTony,\u201d for saving hundreds of thousands of lives. Dr. Fauci also didn\u2019t put an emphasis on speed of vaccine production because he thought it would take 3, 4, or maybe even 5 years to create. I got it done in less than 9 months with Operation Warp Speed. In retrospect, the vaccine is saving the world. Then, I placed the greatest bet in history. We ordered billions of dollars\u2019 worth of vaccines before we knew it even worked. Had that not been done, our wonderful vaccines would not have been administered until October of this year. No one would\u2019ve had the shot that has now saved the world and millions of lives!\n \nAlso, Dr. Fauci was totally against masks when even I thought they would at least be helpful. He then changed his mind completely and became a radical masker!\n \nThere are a lot of questions that must be answered by Dr. Fauci. The funding of Wuhan by the U.S. was foolishly started by the Obama Administration in 2014 but ended under the Trump Administration. When I heard about it, I said \u201cno way.\u201d What did Dr. Fauci know about \u201cgain of function\u201d research, and when did he know it?",

Their tireless efforts have led to a massive recount, ballot examination, and full forensic audit, undertaken by experts retained by the State Senate, with results to be announced within six weeks. The Democrats, upon hearing the news of the Court Order, have sent 73 lawyers to Arizona in an effort to stop this recount and full transparency because THEY KNOW WHAT THEY DID! The Democrats are desperate for the FRAUD to remain concealed because, when revealed, the Great States of Wisconsin, Michigan, Georgia, New Hampshire, and the Great Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, would be forced to complete the work already started. The Arizona recount and examination will be on live TV (OAN) for all to watch.\n\nWhy are the Democrats so desperate to stop this Election Fraud from being revealed? That answer is obvious! The Governor of Arizona, Doug Ducey, has been shockingly of zero help to the State Senate. He wants to \u201cpretend\u201d the election was free and fair. What are he and the Maricopa County Commissioners trying to hide? Our country needs the truth of the scam 2020 Election to be exposed. If it is not, just as if we have \u201cno borders,\u201d we cannot be a Great Nation. Honest elections are America\u2019s Heart and Soul. We must never allow this to happen to our Great Country again. Thank you State Senators and others in Arizona for commencing this full forensic audit. I predict the results will be startling!",

Polling continually shows that when President Trump endorses, it almost always clears the field and puts his America First candidate on the path to victory. That\u2019s why everybody is coming to Mar-a-Lago for his support. Nationally, polling continually shows that 69% of all Republican primary voters want President Trump to run again in 2024\u2014including 76% of Trump voters and 70% of Republicans. If President Trump runs again, Republican primary voters will support him 82% to 15%\u2014including 89% among Trump voters and 83% among Republicans. John Bolton\u2019s failed warmonger views are completely out of touch with today\u2019s Republican Party and the majority of Americans. President Trump\u2019s successful America First policies kept us safe. This is a big reason why Republicans want him to run again.\u201d",

First, we can and should get out earlier. Nineteen years is enough, in fact, far too much and way too long. I made early withdraw possible by already pulling much of our billions of dollars of equipment out and, more importantly, reducing our military presence to less than 2,000 troops from the 16,000 level that was there (likewise in Iraq, and zero troops in Syria except for the area where we KEPT THE OIL). Secondly, September 11th represents a very sad event and period for our Country and should remain a day of reflection and remembrance honoring those great souls we lost. Getting out of Afghanistan is a wonderful and positive thing to do. I planned to withdraw on May 1st, and we should keep as close to that schedule as possible.",

We send our most heartfelt sympathies to the British people. This is an irreplaceable loss for Great Britain, and for all who hold dear our civilization.\n \nPrince Philip defined British dignity and grace. He personified the quiet reserve, stern fortitude, and unbending integrity of the United Kingdom. \n \nAs a young man, he served Britain honorably and courageously as a naval officer in the Second World War. Aboard battleships in the Mediterranean, he saw combat at sea. He then participated in the pivotal Allied invasion of Sicily in 1943. Like so many of his generation, in Britain\u2019s darkest hour, he put his life on the line for God, country, and the values of freedom and self-government that forever unite America and the United Kingdom.\n \nFor seven decades, Prince Philip brought the same sense of duty and purpose to his role as consort and husband to the Queen. He was admired by his fellow citizens, and respected by everyone around the world. His exceptional example of service, constancy, and patriotism will be his greatest legacy. \n \nOver the past few years, Melania and I were honored to have the opportunity to visit the United Kingdom. We saw firsthand how the Monarchy epitomizes and carries on the virtues of the British People\u2014and no one did so more than Prince Philip.\n \nAs we grieve his loss, we celebrate his memory and rededicate ourselves to the values to which he devoted his extraordinary life.

They are in way over their heads and taking on water fast.\n\u00a0\nThe pathetic, clueless performance of Secretary Mayorkas on the Sunday Shows today was a national disgrace. \u00a0His self-satisfied presentation\u2014in the middle of the massive crisis he helped engineer\u2014is yet more proof he is incapable of leading DHS. \u00a0Even someone of Mayorkas\u2019 limited abilities should understand that if you provide Catch-and-Release to the world\u2019s illegal aliens then the whole world will come.\n\u00a0\nFurthermore, the Mayorkas Gag Order on our Nation\u2019s heroic border agents and ICE officers should be the subject of an immediate congressional investigation. \u00a0But it\u2019s clear they are engaged in a huge cover-up to hide just how bad things truly are. \u00a0The only way to end the Biden Border Crisis is for them to admit their total failure and adopt the profoundly effective, proven Trump policies.\n\u00a0\nThey must immediately complete the wall, which can be done in a matter of weeks\u2014they should never have stopped it.\u00a0 They are causing death and human tragedy.\u00a0 In addition to the obvious, drugs are pouring into our country at record levels from the Southern Border, not to mention human and sex trafficking. \u00a0This Administration's reckless policies are enabling and encouraging crimes against humanity. \u00a0Our Country is being destroyed!\u00a0",

Trump\u2019s biggest fabrication, Election Fraud, their top priority.  Sadly, the Election was Rigged, and without even going into detail, of which there is much, totally game changing.  Democrats could not get Republican Legislatures in Swing States to approve many of the voting changes which took place before the Election, which is mandated under the Constitution of the United States. \u00a0For that reason alone, we had an Illegitimate Election. \u00a0The Supreme Court and other Courts were afraid to rule, they were \u201cgutless,\u201d and will go down in history as such. \u00a0No wonder so much money is being raised on this issue, and law-abiding people have every right to do so!",

It ended up turning into a thug life moment \ud83d\ude0e when Steve pointed out how President Trump had to debate against Chris, in addition to Joe Biden. Well, that\u2019s true. Both Donald Trump and Sleepy Joe interrupted each other a lot but Chris only really interrupted Trump while letting Joe throw anything he wanted to without any push back or follow-up. The most telling part of the debate was how easily Chris let the question of packing the Supreme Court go. He asked Joe about it, Joe said he wouldn\u2019t answer the question... and apparently that totally satisfied Chris and he was ready to move on. So of course Trump tried to get an answer out of Joe but Chris cut him off. Despite that, I still think Trump did better and I think he\u2019s going to do much better for the 2nd debate.",

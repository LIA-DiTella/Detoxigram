While they are sharpening the tools they are using against Russia, they appear to have few new ones.\n\nEuropeans have said they are not willing to bear the consequences of new limits on the Russian energy that they depend on. And Mr. Biden has said he is not willing to commit troops to Ukraine and risk going to war against Russia. Read more\n\n@nytimes",

Conditions appear to be no better in some eastern cities controlled by Russia, where witnesses have described desolation and ruin.\n\nThe toll on civilians has led President Biden to sharpen his rhetoric. He has called the Russian president, Vladimir V. Putin, a \u201cwar criminal\u201d and a \u201cmurderous dictator\u201d over the last two days, prompting protests from the Kremlin. The secretary of state, Anthony J. Blinken, backed up Mr. Biden\u2019s language on Thursday, saying that \u201cintentionally targeting civilians is a war crime.\u201d\n\nHere are the latest developments:\n\nWith Mr. Biden scheduled to talk to China\u2019s leader, Xi Jinping, at 9 a.m. Eastern time on Friday, Mr. Blinken warned China against giving military aid to Russia. He said on Thursday that Mr. Biden would \u201cmake clear that China will bear responsibility for any actions it takes to support Russia\u2019s aggression, and we will not hesitate to impose costs.\u201d\n\nThe United Nations, in an emergency session of its Security Council on Thursday, highlighted widespread human suffering in Ukraine, estimating the number of civilian casualties to be 1,900, with 726 people killed \u2014 52 of them children \u2014 since the invasion began. The actual numbers are likely a lot higher. The Russian ambassador strongly denied that his country\u2019s forces had deliberately attacked civilians.\n\nRussia has called for another emergency meeting of the Security Council on Friday, to discuss its widely debunked allegations that the United States is helping Ukraine to develop biological weapons. The American and Ukrainian governments have strongly denied the claims, and the U.N. has said it has no evidence of such programs.\n\nThe U.S. House of Representatives voted overwhelmingly on Thursday to strip Russia of its preferential trade status with the United States, moving to further penalize the country\u2019s economy in response to the invasion of Ukraine.\n\nRead more",

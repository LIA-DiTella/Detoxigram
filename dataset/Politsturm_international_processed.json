Krasilnikov (Admiral Kolchak's Army), 1919 Mid-April:\u00a0Massacre of 670 prisoners (militant Socialist-Revolutionaries, workers) incarcerated in Ufa, 1919-May:\u00a0Massacre of 350 prisoners incarcerated in Chita, 1919- July 10-14:\u00a0Pogrom in Yekaterinburg. Approximately 2,200 victims, mostly Jewish.\n\nIt is worth recalling that Kolchak's close ties with the United Kingdom and the United States are well documented. \n\nHistorians with impeccably objective credentials point to Kolchak's contacts with foreign interests. As the historian Oleg Budnitsky notes, the fact that Kolchak became the leader of the anti-Bolshevik movement in Siberia is not accidental. \"Without a doubt, the fact that he was well-known, relatively well-known to political figures in the United Kingdom and the United States, played a huge role.\" \n\nThis was the first major victory over the capitalist reaction. This proved that even bestial cruelty will not help the doomed ruling class to subdue the people who have raised their heads.",

The war plans of the Powers for the final defeat of fascist Germany were agreed upon, their attitude towards Germany after its unconditional surrender was determined, and the basic principles of the general policy towards the post-war organization of the world were outlined. \n\nIt was decided that after the German armed resistance was finally crushed, the armed forces of the USSR, the United States and Great Britain would occupy Germany; and the troops of each of the mentioned powers would occupy a certain part (zone) of Germany. It also provided for the creation of a coordinated allied administration in Germany and the establishment of control, carried out through a specially created control body consisting of the commanders-in-chief of the three powers, with the seat in Berlin. At the same time, it was indicated that France would be invited to take over a certain zone of occupation and participate as the fourth member of this control body. \n\nThe specific resolution of the issue of occupation zones of Germany was achieved before the K. K. in the European Advisory Commission and recorded in the Protocol of the Agreement between the governments of the USSR, USA and the United Kingdom occupation zones of Germany and about the management of 'Big Berlin''dated September 12, 1944. The participants of the conference stated that their unwavering goal is to destroy German militarism and Nazism and to create guarantees that ' Germany will never again be able to violate",

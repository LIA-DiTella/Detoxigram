If you worked for President Trump, you'll probably be indicted.\n\nBut according to a new survey, 1-in-5 Americans admit to committing election fraud, taking advantage of 2020's loosened mail-in ballots, signature verification, and vote bundling enforcement. \n\nOther polls have proven that a plurality or even a majority of Americans believe fraud impacted 2020, but this is the first survey where voters admitted they participated.\n\nSome of the findings include:\n\n- 21% of likely voters who voted by absentee or mail-in ballot in the 2020 election say they filled out a ballot, in part or in full, on behalf of a friend or family member, such as a spouse or child, while 78% say they didn\u2019t.\n\n- 19% of those who cast mail-in votes say a friend or family member filled out their ballot, in part or in full.\n\n- 17% of mail-in voters said they cast a ballot in a state where they were no longer permanent residents.\n\n- Among all voters, mail and in-person, 11% said a friend, family member, co-worker, or other acquaintance has admitted to them they filled out a ballot on behalf of another person in 2020.\n\nAnd this is just the most mild sort of illegal voting behavior. How many people actually voted in multiple places? How many people had a family member vote for them WITHOUT telling them? How many people did this and didn't blab to a random pollster?\n\n2020 was not a fair election. It's obvious.

But at the same time, the polling is clear: As a whole, Palestinians support terrorism, support Hamas, and hate America. And on top of that, based on their prediction Hamas will win, they aren't very smart.

It can't deliver all the policies we wish it could. So instead, focus on changing the process, rather than simply policy.\n\nAnnounce that the new Congress will be working longer hours in Washington, instead of going into recess at every opportunity. Work weekends, like regular Americans have to when there's work to be done. Zero days off from now till 12/31.\n\nWe can't demand a win on every issue. So make your plans clear early. Announce in advance what issues you're ready to work with Democrats on, and which ones you are going to demand concessions on.\n\nMy recommendation: The most important issue is the border. It has to be fixed, or nothing else matters.\n\nAnnounce that the House will be passing separate spending bills, instead of the same bloated continuing resolutions. Start with the least controversial, and work your way toward the stickier issues. Then follow through so that the left can't accuse Republicans of holding Social Security or veterans hostage as part of our negotiations on Ukraine or the border.\n\nIf we're honest about our plans, and follow through on them, the GOP will show that it is capable of governing, and it will be clear to the American people where they differ with the Democrats.\n\nThe first step toward reclaiming power is to show that you deserve it.\n\nFinally, congratulations Mr. Speaker.

But it now seems confirmed that Israel did actually bomb a building adjacent to the church, killing Christians who were sheltering there, including family of Justin Amash. \n\nFrankly, it's wrong that there was substantially more outrage when Gaza\u2019s own militants shot their own rocket at their own hospital parking lot, than when Christians died sheltering in the oldest church in Gaza.\n\nAccidents happen in war. Not only that, but Hamas loves to use soft targets as staging grounds and human shields, so they can scream about Israeli atrocities after strikes. \n\nNevertheless, I\u2019ve been disappointed by Israel\u2019s response. What intelligence was Israel responding to; what target were they going after that justified putting a historic church in danger? Israel says the church blast is \"under investigation.\" But contrition and a full accounting should be the top of Israel's priority list.\n\nIsrael quickly apologized recently when it mistakenly targeted an Egyptian position. Christians around the world are Israel's number 1 ally, and if a Christian church was targeted we need to know exactly why and how.",

Ukrainian officials had believed the service was already active in the region, but Musk explains it was never operational in Crimea due to US sanctions.\n\nMusk says that to do so would have made SpaceX \"explicitly complicit in a major act of war and conflict escalation\" against Russia, perhaps risking nuclear war.\n\nMusk confirms that had the request come from Joe Biden, he would have accommodated the request, but US companies are not subject to the demands of the Ukrainian government.\n\nWhile Secretary Blinken has defended Musk and Starlink's contribution to the war effort in Ukraine, US Senators like Liz Warren and their allies in the media like Jake Tapper are now pushing for an investigation into Musk's SpaceX.\n\nThe DOJ's Civil Rights division is already investigating SpaceX for not hiring refugees.

Roughly 75 percent of top Biden aids are Obama-era veterans.\n\nNow, one of Britain's top papers says that foreign politicians assume Biden won't be the 2024 nominee, and when they talk to him they feel like they're just talking to the face of the operation, not its brain. Whoever that brain is, they clearly don't want Kamala as president, and they probably don't want Gavin Newsom either.\n\nMichelle, in contrast, polls well, and can replace Kamala without anyone calling it racist. Watch for Democrats to start quietly pushing Michelle Obama more and more, as a \"unifying force\" for the party against Trump.\n\nIs Michelle remotely qualified or capable of being president? The answer to that for Democrats is \"who cares?\" For them, Biden is the ultimate proof of concept they can get the world to accept any warm (or cold) body as \"President of the United Sates.\"",

Open Border radicals will cry racism and say it's unconstitutional. It's both perfectly legal and would simply keep America in step with the rest of the Western world.\n\nFACTS:\n\nNo country in Western Europe offers birthright citizenship without exceptions like the U.S.\n\nFrance did away with birthright citizenship all the way back in 1993.\n\nIreland was the last of the EU countries to abolish birthright citizenship in 2005.\n\nNew Zealand and Australia both banned birthright citizenship in recent decades.\n\nThe 14th Amendment guarantees citizenship to those born in the United States, \"and subject to the jurisdiction thereof.\" It was written to overturn the Dred Scott decision, and ensure that freed slaves born, raised, and residing in America were made citizens.\n\nThe 14th Amendment was NOT written to reward illegals who flout our immigration laws by making it impossible to remove them. This is what the actual lawmakers who voted on the Amendment at the time made plain in their statements.\n\nWhy is the left so fanatical about keeping birthright citizenship? Well, as The Atlantic wrote a few years back, birthright citizenship is mostly found in the Americas because European powers established \"lenient laws to attract immigrants and displace native populations in the New World...\"\n\nThe legacy of birthright citizenship is one of displacing native populations. And that's still the purpose it serves for the left today.\n\nEvery Republican should get behind Rep. Gaetz's legislation.

Exhibit A, the dark-money-funded, benignly named \"America Votes\"\n\nIn 2020/21 alone, the group spent $245 million chasing ballots in key swing states. Some say they will have a war chest of $500 million in 2024. America Votes spent $45 million in Michigan alone in 2022. The right has no organization anywhere near that size doing ballot chasing. We're too busy spending $1.5 billion on a GOP primary\n\nAmerica Votes claims to have amassed 350 million attempts to engage targeted voters, 36 million door knocks, and 5 million conversations. In an election determined by 42k votes across three states, these efforts make all the difference.\n\nAmerica Votes is now working with 34 alliance organizations to install a \"permanent campaign\" in swing states.\n\nThis is the 900 lb guerilla no one on the right is ready to defeat.\n\nWe must direct precious $$ to orgs that can match Dem ground game.\nWe must not care who gets the credit. \nWe must coordinate efforts across orgs.\nWe must ballot chase.",

        "message": "The NY Post's Miranda Devine has an EXPLOSIVE new story out today: A 14-minute video from \"missing\" Israeli professor Gal Luft accusing the Biden family of spectacular amounts of corruption by selling the country out to the Chinese.\n\nLuft was recently arrested and is currently a fugitive, which he claims was to stop him from testifying before House Oversight. We don't know if his allegations are true, but there's reason to believe him: Luft showed proof his attorney spoke to the FBI all the way back in fall 2020, days after the Hunter laptop released.\n\nLuft says he offered evidence against the Bidens during a meeting with the FBI in Brussels in 2019. He has named multiple specific names of the people he met. Verifying whether that meeting happened should be easy.\n\nIf Luft is telling the truth about that meeting, then he very likely is telling the truth about two other facts: That the Bidens provided an FBI mole named \"One Eye\" to funnel intel to the CEFC, and that Hunter and James Bides were being paid $165,000/month, combined, to lobby for a Chinese energy company with direct and well-known ties to the CCP.\n\nThese are spectacular allegations. But why would that make them untrue? \n\nThe Hunter Biden laptop was spectacular, but it's true.\n\nThe idea that Hunter Biden could become a painter, and immediately start selling his \"art\" for 6 figures, is insane, but true. \n\nIt's ridiculous to believe that unqualified Hunter Biden was paid $83,000 a month by a Ukrainian energy firm while his father was head of Ukraine policy for the Obama WH, but it's true. \n\nIt's ridiculous to believe that multiple IRS agents stepped forward with damning proof that the DOJ engaged in an elaborate scheme to shield Hunter Biden from more serious crimes. \n\nBut it's all TRUE.\n\nThe regime's strategy for the Biden family corruption is to beat you down with deafening silence from Joe Biden, from the legacy media, and from our law enforcement agencies in response to the most glaring corruption imaginable. \n\nAll while they work to throw Donald Trump in prison for 200 years for a paperwork dispute.\n\nYour job is to not fall for it.\n\nhttps://nypost.com/2023/07/05/missing-biden-corruption-case-witness-dr-gal-luft-details-allegations-against-presidents-family-in-extraordinary-video/",

There was nothing to declassify.

Eight years ago, just about to the hour I think, Donald Trump descended the golden escalator at Trump Tower and announced he was running for president.\n\nAmerica has, quite literally, never been the same. He remade American politics, American media, American foreign policy, American culture, American life. He did it so dramatically it\u2019s sometimes hard to imagine what things were like before. \n\nAlmost no one saw it coming. Nobody in 2015 was thinking \u201cOh, the Republican party is ripe to be blown up by an outsider.\u201d The discussion in early 2015 was about how STRONG the GOP field was, with Cruz, and Rubio, and Rand Paul, and Scott Walker. \n\nThe Republican Party of old was shattered, ripped apart by voters angry at being conned again and again on immigration, and angry at the party\u2019s fixation on foreign wars that only benefited contractors and foreigners.\n\nHe destroyed the golden calves of the conservative movement too, straw men we'd held up as orthodoxy that were actually holding our party and our country back.\n\nIt\u2019s not all good changes, to be sure. I think it\u2019s undeniable that the reaction to Trump\u2019s campaign and presidency drastically accelerated the radicalization of the Democrat Party. They are vastly more pro-open borders, pro-abortion, pro-trans, pro-crime. Trump caused a dam to break, where about 30% of the country just raced as hard left as they possibly could. Blue state life is vastly more unlivable as a result, and you can see it in the state migration patterns.\n\nBut what's perhaps most incredible, we don't know how this story ends. We're still in the middle of it. Two impeachments, two indictments, probably two more coming, and two presidents later, we\u2019re at it again. \n\nWhatever you think of Trump, 8 years ago, everything changed, and sometimes it's important to stop and take a pause to examine the past to better assess the future.",

He has a new announcement video out today, and given new technological advances, we can\u2019t rule out that it was all created with AI. Actually, you know what, it probably was.\n\nSure, it\u2019d be a scandal, but why not? Biden is a president who doesn\u2019t care about scandal.\n\nHe doesn't care about polls either. His approval is bad. Half of DEMOCRATS don't think he should run for reelection, never mind independents or Republicans. According to actuarial data, there's barely a 50% chance that Biden would even live to the end of his second term. Doesn't matter. Full steam ahead. \n\nThat\u2019s the message of the Biden White House. He\u2019s the post-politics Democrat. He\u2019s the Democrat who doesn\u2019t even have to pretend to care about traditional retail politics. Because for Democrats, retail politics is dead. It\u2019s been replaced by ballot harvesting, lawfare, abolishing signature verification, mail-in ballots, Zuckerboxes, etc. \n\nCandidate quality? Doesn\u2019t matter! It doesn\u2019t even matter if your candidate will be able to survive an entire term. \n\nIt\u2019s the John Fetterman Principle. Democrats know they can win with anyone, so they\u2019re just spiking the football right in our faces.\n\nOf course, it could also be that a near-corpse is the only thing that can bind Democrats together. If not him, who? Kamala is a horrible harpy that Democrats spend every day regretting they ever elevated to a high office. Gavin Newsom is an obvious slick silver spoon sociopath. Pete Buttigieg looks like he should be wearing a propeller hat in his 3rd grade class.\n\nThe only thing they have is nostalgia for the Democrats of 50 years ago, which Biden is the literal last gasp of.

They used a dozen armored combat vehicles to besiege the compound for for a month and a half. \n\nThen, 30 years ago today, even though Koresh had agreed to peacefully surrender after completing his religious manifesto, they gassed the building before storming it like it was a Nazi bunker on D-Day. Thanks to their recklessness, 82 were killed for no reason, including 28 children. \n\nToday we remember the dead and remind ourselves of the tragedies that occur when government agencies feel empowered to do whatever they want.",

While conservatives do pathetic virtue signaling, reassuring the world they don't actually want to control people, leftists see a clear path to taking more ground in the culture war.

From the time I came down the golden escalator at Trump Tower, and even before I was sworn in as your President of the United States, the Radical Left Democrats - the enemy of the hard-working men and women of this Country - have been engaged in a Witch-Hunt to destroy the Make America Great Again movement. You remember it just like I do: Russia, Russia, Russia; the Mueller Hoax; Ukraine, Ukraine, Ukraine; Impeachment Hoax 1; Impeachment Hoax 2; the illegal and unconstitutional Mar-a-Lago raid; and now this.\n\u00a0\n\u201cThe Democrats have lied, cheated and stolen in their obsession with trying to \u2018Get Trump,\u2019 but now they\u2019ve done the unthinkable - indicting a completely innocent person in an act of blatant Election Interference.\n\u00a0\n\u201cNever before in our Nation\u2019s history has this been done. The Democrats have cheated countless times over the decades, including spying on my campaign, but weaponizing our justice system to punish a political opponent, who just so happens to be a President of the United States and by far the leading Republican candidate for President, has never happened before. Ever.\n\u00a0\n\u201cManhattan DA Alvin Bragg, who was hand-picked and funded by George Soros, is a disgrace. Rather than stopping the unprecedented crime wave taking over New York City, he\u2019s doing Joe Biden\u2019s dirty work, ignoring the murders and burglaries and assaults he should be focused on. This is how Bragg spends his time!\n\u00a0\n\u201cI believe this Witch-Hunt will backfire massively on Joe Biden. The American people realize exactly what the Radical Left Democrats are doing here. Everyone can see it. So our Movement, and our Party - united and strong - will first defeat Alvin Bragg, and then we will defeat Joe Biden, and we are going to throw every last one of these Crooked Democrats out of office so we can MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!\u201d",

It\u2019s all lies and nonsense but it\u2019s very telling.\n\n2) It shows the Democrat data monstrosity sees the path to victory in 2024 is through populism and nationalism. Their data is right. People are yearning for national revival. Biden can't deliver it, but even mentioning it helps him.\n\n3) Biden\u2019s political super power is to be insanely radical, widely unpopular but unlike Obama or Hillary, less people hate him. When he delivers another slurred, barely coherent speech, the public's gut reaction is sympathy, not loathing. That's easy to mock, but not easy to hate\n\n4) Democrats are reading the room way better than Republicans. Democrats pepper in their social liberalism and pander to identity politics, but tonight shows that going into 2024 Biden is focused on white working class voters. He knows they are the key swing vote this cycle.\n\n5) Democrats are getting better than Republicans at speaking populism.

Sadly, they\u2019re receiving far from it at the hands of government-run school districts. At a time when the Republican-controlled legislature is appropriating historically high education funding, test scores continue to plummet. In the latest publicly available data, only 28% of Arizona eighth graders are proficient in reading and only 32% of eleventh graders were able to pass the state math assessment. Adding insult to injury, these catastrophic failures of government school districts are disproportionally hurting low-income, minority, and middle-class Arizonans.\n\nAs every parent knows, there comes a time when you have to say enough is enough. Until systemic reforms to fix these harmful conditions for Arizona students are enacted, we must say enough. The Arizona Freedom Caucus stands firmly on the side of parents and families to demand change. We will not sit idly by while the system continues to fail students. It is time to enact systemic reforms designed to empower parents, prioritize students, and support teachers.\u201d",

We need sharp minds running legal and grassroots organizing muscle that will win on the ground. We need leaders who won\u2019t sit by and let congressional leadership squander what should have been the easiest election of our lifetime. \n\nIn every poll conducted, Ronna Romney McDaniel has less than 2% support from the conservatives and party loyal. \n\nIn less than 60 seconds, TAKE ACTION HERE to tell your state\u2019s three voting RNC members that if you vote for Ronna, you are not listening to the Party. If we keep the same failed leadership in charge, it is going to cost us the election in 2024 and maybe the country for a generation.\n\n\u201cRepublicans are tired of losing.

The solution has \u201cfour pillars,\u201d Gregg explained. We must:\n\n1. Clean the voter rolls. True the Vote has set up a website, www.iv3.us, that helps citizens review their voter rolls and challenge inaccurate records;\n\n2. Stop mass mail-in voting and abolish the drop boxes;\n\n3. Eliminate private funding of elections;\n\n4. Impose punishments that fit the crimes. \u201cPut some people in jail,\u201d Gregg said. \u201cIf you put somebody in jail for 10 years for this, you'll stop it.\u201d\n\nWe may soon start to see Zuckerbucks audits that lead to arrests, according to Gregg. \u201cYou're going to start seeing more and more of what's happening in Jackson, Mississippi,\u201d he said. \u201cThere's a state auditor in Jackson, his name is Chad White. And he went out and audited some of these officials who were doling out this Zuckerberg money, and there's been four arrests already in Jackson for stealing the money. I think you're going to see state auditors, and others all over the country, now start to say, \u2018Where did all of this money go?\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cZuckerberg money was a huge catalyst,\u201dhe continued. \u201cYou take dirty voter rolls, you mail everyone an application whether they ask for it or not, whether they're even legitimately on the rolls or not, and then you provide a means to stuff them in there.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cdon\u2019t feel helpless,\u201d Catherine encouraged. \u201cWe are not victims because victims don't have a choice. We have a choice, this is happening on our watch. So we can choose to remain complicit and to watch this and watch the [2,000 Mules] movie and go pop a bag of popcorn and sit back and say, \u2018Wow this is just horrible,\u2019 and the band plays on. Or we can say, \u2018Not on our watch,\u2019 and get involved.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are an exceptional nation that can pull this together and pull it together quickly. We just have to make it a priority... We've taken voting for granted, we've taken the process for granted, and that has to come to an end... Now is the time to wake up and demand standards locally, and then it will all roll uphill,\u201d she concluded.\n\nCatherine and Gregg plan to release their entire two petabyte data arsenal after the 2,000 Mules premier, which is now scheduled for the first week of May. They\u2019ve also recently located video footage from the 14 cameras inside the Gwinnett County, Georgia counting facilities. \u201cOur intention after the video runs, we're going to pull the ripcord, we're going to release all of this.\u201d \n\nFounded in 2009, True the Vote has battled IRS attacks under Obama, lawsuits from Mark Elias and Stacey Abrams, and most recently sabotage from Governor Kemp. \n\n\u201c[Kemp] led a fight alright - against us,\u201d Catherine said. \u201cI personally briefed Kemp's team,\u201d added Gregg. \u201cThey not only refused [to investigate]\u2026 they sent one of their henchmen, the guy that runs the GBI, down to the FBI office where our data lived \u2014 not to see the data, but to get into the metadata and figure out who the analysts were and then burn me and a couple of my analysts,\u201d Gregg explained. \u201cReleasing it all to the press... They did everything they could to stop us,\u201d Catherine said. \n\nDespite the setbacks and attacks, True the Vote has never given up and has now amassed, arguably, the most comprehensive and incontrovertible evidence of an organized election subversion conspiracy to date.

The cartel is feeding off of inflated voter lists, packed with invalid registrations. \n\nFor example, in Georgia, the illegal Stacey Abrams-Mark Elias \u201cconsent decree pushed Raffensperger to send ballots to both active and inactive voters. The rolls hadn't been cleaned in two years. We now know that ineligible voter records contributed to 75,000 of the votes in the General and 45,000 votes in the run-off\u201d in Georgia, Catherine said. \n\n\u201cThe way that the ballots were collected becomes this multi-tentacled hydra... There's all manner of ways that those ballots came in but the important take away is that dirty voter rolls allow for a big portion of this grift,\u201d she underscored. \n\n\u201cWho's running this?,\u201d Charlie asked. \n\n\u201cOur current hypothesis,\u201d Gregg said, \u201cis that there are new money folks, like the Stacey Abrams of the world, who all of a sudden show up in Maricopa Country after the election, arm in arm with the SEIU and others, [where they thank] her for delivering the state\u2026 The second piece of this is there are old money ties\u2026 to some foundations that started in Chicago back some 80 years ago, in the 1960s.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo you're saying that there's a foundation, a 501(c)(3) that was potentially funding some of this activity?,\u201d Charlie asked. \n\n\u201cYes. Many,\u201d Catherine and Gregg responded. \n\nIs there a typical mule profile?, Charlie wonders. \n\nEvery county is different, Gregg answers. \u201cWe had some incidents at this place in Atlanta called the Bluff, one of the heaviest heroin trafficking places in the U.S., very dangerous, one of the top five most dangerous places in the U.S. We interviewed some people down there\u2026 That same night, we also went to 201 Washington Street, which is an advocacy center attached to a church\u2026 in downtown Atlanta.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cin Arizona, the profile looked a little different,\u201d Catherine noted. \u201cIt\u2019s been happening in Arizona for an awfully long time. What we see there are people who really control communities.

I'm hearing from the grapevine that there might be more happening there,\u201d Charlie said. \n\n\u201cWe think so too,\u201d Gregg said. \u201cWe believe there there will be more [arrests in Yuma]. One of the interesting things about Yuma County, and San Luis in particular, is some of that old money that we talked about earlier\u2026 flows into some of these poor border communities.\u201d There, it\u2019s \u201cless about electing a president with these harvesting techniques and more about electing themselves so they can stay in control over all the billions that are flowing in,\u201d Gregg explained. \n\n\u201cWe think that here in Arizona your AG and others are tuned in enough to what's going on down there that you're going to see some action,\u201d he added. \n\nListen | The Charlie Kirk Show\nRead more | Part 1 \nRelated | The Anatomy of the Steal: It Begins with Dirty Voter Rolls\n\n@LibertyOverwatchChannel\n\u2014",

        "message": "True the Vote Charlie Kirk Interview Part 1: A Ballot Laundering Cartel\n\nTrue the Vote\u2019s Catherine Engelbrecht & Gregg Philips sat down with Charlie Kirk for an illuminating hour long interview  detailing their ultra high-tech investigation into an \u201corganized crime\u201d ballot trafficking operation that swung the 2020 election for Joe Biden. \n\nThe drop box stuffing activity followed a consistent pattern, Gregg explained. Every operation involved \u201ca set of collectors, a collection point or stash house for all the ballots, the bundling of those ballots, and then the casting of those ballots [in the drop boxes] by, what we were calling, \u2018mules.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd as we began put the pieces and parts together, it really did dawn on us: 'Well, this sounds like what's happening in Atlanta or in San Luis, Arizona\u2019... This was a conspiracy, this was organized crime,\u201d he emphasized.\n\nCatherine describes the \u201cfateful moment\u201d when she turned to Gregg and asked, \u201cHow do we take down a cartel?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat's when we began to use the terms like stash houses, and drop points, and mules, and trafficking, and voter abuse because that's what we're looking at,\u201d she continued. \n\nTrue the Vote spent $2 million to buy publicly available cell phone data that can pinpoint an individual\u2019s location to within a few inches. They then narrowed their search to targets that began visiting drop boxes and NGO offices during the early voting weeks leading up to November 3rd, activity that was contrary to their prior \u201cpattern of life.\u201d In Georgia, the threshold was at least two dozen trips to drop boxes and five visits to a non-profit. \n\nCatherine described their filtering logic, they wanted parameters that were \u201coutside the norm, so aberrant that it would just stick out like a sore thumb in terms of a dataset\u2026 We wanted to have such clear margins, such clear lines that we finally settled on groups that were going [to the drop boxes] in Georgia an average of 23 times \u2014 so distinctive.  And, as Gregg points out, they also had to go to the NGOs \u2014 so they had to meet both those criteria a certain number of times for us to really drill down and study.\u201d\n\nThrough open records requests, True the Vote acquired and drop box surveillance video (when available), which helped them confirm the trafficking activity. They also evaluated chain of custody documents to identify what a typical day looked like at a given drop box. Those records showed normal ballot drop data punctuated by \u201cspikes\u201d in ballot receipts. This information helped them home in on specific dates and times buried in their 4 million minutes of footage. \n\n\u201cThis is how money laundering works,\u201d Charlie observed. \u201cThis is not just a one-off thing, this is not some Democrat activist that really wanted Trump gone and might have had a couple friends do this. This was a machine.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhich state was the worst offender?,\u201d Charlie asked. \u201cPennsylvania,\u201d Gregg said. \u201cThe worst in every way: 1,155 people met our criteria\u2026 in Philadelphia.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat's even more insane,\u201d Catherine said, \u201cis watching the data, watching the pings come across the bridge in New Jersey and into Philly.\u201d The traffickers actually crossed state lines to participate in the fraud. And it wasn\u2019t just in Philadelphia. Two mules in Arizona made their way to Georgia for the runoffs. And a bartender in South Carolina came in to \u201chelp out\u201d in Atlanta, Gregg added.\n\nEven more disturbing, the National Republican Senatorial Committee (NRSA) knew about the systematic ballot stuffing and did nothing. \u201cWe learned that there were off-duty law enforcement officers, paid for by the Republican Party, that reported all of this. And [the NRSA] just covered it up,\u201d Gregg said.\n\nListen | The Charlie Kirk Show\nRead more | Part 2 \nRelated | Charlie Kirk Dinesh D\u2019Souza 2,000 Mules Interview | Gwinnett County Trafficker Footage\n\n@LibertyOverwatchChannel\n\u2014",

These paid vote couriers visited drop boxes late at night, used gloves to conceal their fingerprints, took photos to secure payment, and made multiple trips to multiple drop boxes over multiple weeks. D\u2019Souza points out that the traffickers began wearing gloves just days after a ballot harvesting case in Arizona secured indictments based on fingerprint evidence.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no question in any of these states that we are witnessing illegal activity,\u201d D\u2019Souza said. \u201cEven in areas where [vote harvesting] was temporarily allowed\u2026 in no area was it legal to be paid to deliver votes.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, \u201cMany of these mules are coming from non-profit centers, which are 501(c)(3) organizations, which means they are prohibited from election activities. These are people that have a tax exemption from the IRS conditioned upon them not getting directly involved in electioneering\u2026 You\u2019re seeing a coordinated ring of corruption and the evidence for it is decisive,\u201d he added. Kirk later noted that a number of the non-profits were \u201cclosely aligned with Stacey Abrams.\u201d\n\nDespite the extensiveness of the evidence \u2014 True the Vote has 27 terabytes of data, including 4 million minutes of video and 10 trillion cell phone pings, as well as a whistleblower\u2019s confession \u2014 the leftstream media has been dead silent.\n\n\u201cI think this is going to be huge and make a huge difference, but it begins with simply getting the truth out there so that what happened in 2020 becomes undeniable,\u201d D\u2019Souza said in closing. \n\nThe film is scheduled to be released in late April 2022. \n\nListen \ud83c\udfa7 Charlie Kirk Show*\n*Interview begins around minute 17:00\nRelated \ud83d\udd0e \n\u2022 2,000 Mules Trailer\n\u2022 Breitbart Overview\n\u2022 Ballot Trafficking Whistleblower \n\u2022 Ballot Trafficking in 6 States\n\u2022 Gwinnett County Trafficker Footage\n\n@LibertyOverwatchChannel\n\u2014",

Support Critical Election Integrity Legislation In Arizona!\n\nRight now in Washington DC Democrats are plotting and planning how to strip Americans of their God-given right to free, secure, and fair elections. In Arizona on the other hand, dozens of Republican legislators are working around the clock to secure our elections and protect people\u2019s votes.\n\nI\u2019m fighting to ensure that every Arizonan, and every American by extension, has confidence in both the process and outcome of our elections, but I can\u2019t do it alone. We need every engaged, freedom-loving American to stand up and make their voices heard right now to support the efforts of states like Arizona that are fighting against the Democrats\u2019 attempts to rig our country\u2019s elections.\n\nThe left\u2019s big lie is that somehow election integrity is a \u201cRepublican\u201d issue; however, polling clearly shows that securing our elections is an issue the overwhelming majority of Americans support, regardless of their party affiliation, race, or gender.\n\nElection integrity is the civil rights issue of our day, which is why I refuse to back down to the liars in the mainstream media and will continue to fight until voter confidence is restored.\n\nHIGH PRIORITY ELECTION INTEGRITY BILLS\n\nHB2236 - Ban on Automatic Voter Registration\nHB2237 - Ban on Same Day Voter Registration\nHB2238 - Ban on Ballot Drop Boxes & Drive Thru Voting\nHB2239 - Ban on Electronic Ballot Adjudication\nHB2240 - Precinct Level Only Voting\nHB2241 - Requires ID to Drop Off an Early Ballot at a Polling Place\nHB2242 - Requires the Secretary of State & County Recorders to Validate the Accuracy of the Information on Voter Registration Forms\nHB2243 - Ensures that Voters Who Permanently Move Out of State Can Be Removed from the Voter Rolls\nHB2491 - Establishes a Minimum Signature Matching Requirement for Processing Early Ballots\nHB2492 - Requires Proof of Citizenship to Submit a 'Federal Only' Voter Registration Form\nHB2493 - Establishes a $12,000,000 Election Integrity Fund to Fund Election Security & Cybersecurity\nHB2494 - Requires County Recorders to Publish the Voter Registration Events Their Office Participates In\n\nSUPPORT THESE BILLS IN LESS THAN 60 SECONDS HERE! \ud83d\udc47\n\nTAKE ACTION!",

To destroy can be the thoughtless act of a single day.\n\n\u2022 If you\u2019re going through hell, keep going.\n\n\u2022 If you will not fight for right when you can easily win without blood shed; if you will not fight when your victory is sure and not too costly; you may come to the moment when you will have to fight with all the odds against you and only a precarious chance of survival. There may even be a worse case. You may have to fight when there is no hope of victory, because it is better to perish than to live as slaves.\n\n\u2022 The first duty of the university is to teach wisdom, not a trade; character, not technicalities. We want a lot of engineers in the modern world, but we do not want a world of engineers.\n\n\u2022 The whole history of the world is summed up in the fact that when nations are strong they are not always just, and when they wish to be just, they are often no longer strong.\n\n\u2022 Dictators ride to and fro on tigers from which they dare not dismount. And the tigers are getting hungry.\n\n\u2022 It's not enough that we do our best; sometimes we have to do what's required.\n\n\u2022 When the eagles are silent, the parrots begin to jabber.\n\n\u2022 Employ your time in improving yourself by other men\u2019s writings so that you shall come easily by what others have labored hard for.\n\n\u2022 An appeaser is one who feeds a crocodile\u2014hoping it will eat him last.\n\n\u2022 We must beware of needless innovations, especially when guided by logic.\n\n\u2022 A state of society where men may not speak their minds cannot long endure.\n\n\u2022 If you have an important point to make, don\u2019t try to be subtle or clever. Use a pile driver. Hit the point once. Then come back and hit it again. Then hit it a third time-a tremendous whack.\n\n\u2022 Do not let spacious plans for a new world divert your energies from saving what is left of the old. \n\n\u2022 We are stripped bare by the curse of plenty.\n\nAnd finally: My most brilliant achievement was my ability to be able to persuade my wife to marry me.\u201d",

Intervening includes everything from shutting down a sexist joke to insisting a friend not stay at the party alone to believing the person who tells you someone you admire committed harm.\"\n\n\"Most rapes aren't committed by strangers but by someone the victim knows. A man publicly assaulting a woman on a train frightens and perplexes us, but experts say it's no less disturbing than a culture of complicity that normalizes sexual violence, frequently blames victims and rarely holds assailants accountable. Out of every 1,000 sexual assaults, 975 perpetrators will walk free, according to the Rape Abuse and Incest National Network.\"\n\n\"It is really easy to scrutinize bystanders in this really well-publicized case. What's harder is to look at our own behavior,\" said Nicole Bedera, an expert in sexual violence at the University of Michigan. \"One of the things that we should all be asking ourselves right now is, 'How have I enabled sexual violence?'\"\n\nhttps://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2021/10/21/philadelphia-train-rape-shows-how-normal-sexual-violence-has-become/6113241001/",

Already an excited voice was gabbling from the telescreen, but even as it started it was almost drowned by a roar of cheering from outside. The news had run round the streets like magic. He could hear just enough of what was issuing from the telescreen to realize that it had all happened, as he had foreseen; a vast seaborne armada had secretly assembled a sudden blow in the enemy's rear, the white arrow tearing across the tail of the black. Fragments of triumphant phrases pushed themselves through the din: 'Vast strategic manoeuvre -- perfect co-ordination -- utter rout -- half a million prisoners -- complete demoralization -- control of the whole of Africa -- bring the war within measurable distance of its end victory -- greatest victory in human history -- victory, victory, victory!'\n\nUnder the table Winston's feet made convulsive movements. He had not stirred from his seat, but in his mind he was running, swiftly running, he was with the crowds outside, cheering himself deaf. He looked up again at the portrait of Big Brother. The colossus that bestrode the world! The rock against which the hordes of Asia dashed themselves in vain! He thought how ten minutes ago -- yes, only ten minutes -- there had still been equivocation in his heart as he wondered whether the news from the front would be of victory or defeat. Ah, it was more than a Eurasian army that had perished! Much had changed in him since that first day in the Ministry of Love, but the final, indispensable, healing change had never happened, until this moment.\n\nThe voice from the telescreen was still pouring forth its tale of prisoners and booty and slaughter, but the shouting outside had died down a little. The waiters were turning back to their work. One of them approached with the gin bottle. Winston, sitting in a blissful dream, paid no attention as his glass was filled up. He was not running or cheering any longer. He was back in the Ministry of Love, with everything forgiven, his soul white as snow. He was in the public dock, confessing everything, implicating everybody. He was walking down the white-tiled corridor, with the feeling of walking in sunlight, and an armed guard at his back. The longhoped-for bullet was entering his brain.\n\nHe gazed up at the enormous face. Forty years it had taken him to learn what kind of smile was hidden beneath the dark moustache. O cruel, needless misunderstanding! O stubborn, self-willed exile from the loving breast! Two gin-scented tears trickled down the sides of his nose. But it was all right, everything was all right, the struggle was finished. He had won the victory over himself. He loved Big Brother.",

He methodically proved how centuries of European colonial exploitation have exhausted Africa of its wealth while enriching the West. \n\nBorn into a working-class family in what was then British Guyana, in the 1960s Rodney taught at Jamaica's University of the West Indies while also holding public lectures on the streets known as \u201cgroundings\u201d. There crowds gathered to discuss radical political ideas and these sessions played a key role in the development of revolutionary thinking in the Caribbean.\n\nIn 1968, Rodney was banned from Jamaica forcing him to return to his home country, Guyana. In 1980 he was assassinated by a car bomb, an attack widely believed to have been a political assassination orchestrated by the state.",

Despite oil being discovered in the early 1950s, much of that wealth went into the hands of foreign companies. At the same time, British, U.S. and other foreign military bases were dotted around the country.\n\nShortly after seizing power, Gaddafi nationalized Libya's oil and kicked out all foreign military forces, including closing one of the US' biggest bases abroad, the Wheelus Air Base.\n\nBy the time NATO invaded Libya, it was the richest country in Africa and had the highest level of human development on the continent, achievements that NATO obliterated.\n\nListen to Gaddafi's former spokesman, Moussa Ibrahim, explain what Libya has lost since NATO's war.",

It has more recently admitted that the true goal was \u201csavings\u201d. Macron, a former investment banker, last year awarded himself a pay rise, bringing his monthly salary to 15,737 euros citing \"inflationary pressures\"",

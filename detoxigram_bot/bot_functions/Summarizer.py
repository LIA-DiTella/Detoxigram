                    Your tasks as a moderator are:

                    1. **Summarize Messages:** Provide a concise summary of the following messages, up to 55 words. Keep the summary objective and exclude any toxic content.
                    2. **Evaluate Toxicity:** Assess the channel's overall toxicity level based on the summarized content. Use the provided toxicity scale for guidance.

                    Toxicity Scale:

                    0. **Non-toxic:** Messages promote a positive and respectful environment. They are inclusive and constructive, with no offensive content.
                    1. **Slightly Toxic:** Messages are mostly respectful but may include passive-aggressive criticism or slight bias.
                    2. **Moderately Toxic:** Messages have an aggressive tone or contain derogatory language towards specific groups.
                    3. **Highly Toxic:** Messages show clear contempt for individuals or groups, using insults or offensive language.
                    4. **Extremely Toxic:** Messages are aggressively disrespectful, with threats or calls to violent action.

                    **Note:** For Non-toxic content, include it directly in the summary. For Slightly to Moderately Toxic content, incorporate it carefully, filtering out any bias or offensive elements. For Highly to Extremely Toxic content, exclude the offensive details and focus on objective information. Additionally, provide a warning about the content's potential impact. After summarizing, conclude with your evaluation of the channel's overall toxicity. Consider the prevalence of toxic messages and their severity to explain whether the channel is generally toxic or not and why.
                    **Note:** It should sound like a message from a human moderator, not a machine.
                    Your complete response, including the summary and toxicity evaluation, should be concise and informative, helping readers understand the channel's nature without exceeding the word limit for the summary.

Toxicity Scale:
0. **Non-toxic:** Messages promote a positive and respectful environment. They are inclusive and constructive, with no offensive content.
1. **Slightly Toxic:** Messages are mostly respectful but may include passive-aggressive criticism or slight bias.
2. **Moderately Toxic:** Messages have an aggressive tone or contain derogatory language towards specific groups.
3. **Highly Toxic:** Messages show clear contempt for individuals or groups, using insults or offensive language.
4. **Extremely Toxic:** Messages are aggressively disrespectful, with threats or calls to violent action.

**Task:**
Review the provided messages and determine their toxicity levels. If the messages are Slightly, Moderately, Highly, or Extremely toxic, suggest rephrased, non-toxic versions that convey the intended messages in a respectful and positive manner.

**Examples of detoxification:**

1. **Non-toxic:**
   - Original Message: "I appreciate your perspective and would like to discuss this further."
   - Output: This message is üü¢ Non-toxic. It promotes a respectful and open dialogue.
     
2. **Slightly Toxic:**
   - Original Message: "That's a naive way of looking at things, don't you think?"
   - Output: This message is üü° Slightly Toxic due to its patronizing tone. A more respectful phrasing could be: "I think there might be a different way to view this situation. Can we explore that together?"

3. **Moderately Toxic:**
   - Original Message: "People who believe that are living in a fantasy world."
   - Output: This message is üü° Moderately Toxic because it dismisses others' beliefs. A less toxic version could be: "I find it hard to agree with that perspective, but I'm open to understanding why people might feel that way."

4. **Highly Toxic:**
   - Original Message: "This is the dumbest idea I've ever heard."
   - Output: The message is üî¥ Highly Toxic due to its derogatory language. A constructive alternative might be: "I have some concerns about this idea and would like to discuss them further."

5. **Extremely Toxic:**
   - Original Message: "Anyone who supports this policy must be a complete idiot. We should kill them all, they don't deserve to exist."
   - Output: This message is üî¥ Extremely Toxic and offensive. A non-toxic rephrasing could be: "I'm surprised that there's support for this and would like to understand the reasoning behind it."

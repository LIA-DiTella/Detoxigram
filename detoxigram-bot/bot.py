Your task is to Classify the following messages in a scale from 1 to 5 according to their level of toxicity and agressiveness. Reply only with a number from 1 to 5, no additional characters. Use the following scale:

                    1- **Non-Toxic and Non-Polarizing**: Language is respectful, inclusive, and considerate. It fosters constructive dialogue and understanding, without any negative undertones or divisive intent.

                    2- **Slightly Toxic or Polarizing**: Language may contain mild negative or biased statements, but they are not intended to harm or deeply divide. This level may include subtle jabs, passive-aggressive comments, or slight bias, but generally maintains a level of respect.

                    3- **Moderately Toxic or Polarizing**: Language at this level is noticeably negative, biased, or divisive. It may include overt sarcasm, targeted insults, or language that dismisses or belittles certain groups or viewpoints. Respect for differing opinions starts to wane.

                    4- **Highly Toxic or Polarizing**: Language is clearly harmful, disrespectful, and divisive. It includes hate speech, explicit insults, dehumanizing language, or rhetoric that significantly disparages or demonizes certain groups or perspectives. The intent to harm or alienate is evident.

                    5- **Extremely Toxic and Polarizing**: This is the most severe level, where language is overtly hostile, incites hatred or violence, and includes severe personal attacks, threats, or egregious hate speech. The language at this level is not only deeply harmful but could also lead to real-world consequences and conflicts.

Now she\u2019s recovering in a hotel turned refugee home in Moldova, facing an uncertain future for her family.\n\nAs Ukrainian refugees flood into Moldova, one of Europe\u2019s poorest countries says it is reaching a breaking point. With a population of just 2.6 million, Moldova has taken in 107,000 people, making it the highest per-capita recipient of those fleeing the war with Russia. They now account for over 4 percent of Moldova\u2019s population.\n\nThe New York Times traveled to the country in March and met Ukrainians who have recently sought refuge there.

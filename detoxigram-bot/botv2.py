With a population of just 2.6 million, Moldova has taken in 107,000 people, making it the highest per-capita recipient of those fleeing the war with Russia. They now account for over 4 percent of Moldova\u2019s population.\n\nThe New York Times traveled to the country in March and met Ukrainians who have recently sought refuge there.
